<h2><a name="THE_HALF-BOARDER" id="THE_HALF-BOARDER">THE HALF-BOARDER.</a></h2>

<p class='p3'>BY MRS ALARIC A. WATTS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a naturalist is desirous of describing any genus of
peculiar interest in the world of nature, we generally
find him selecting one of the kind as a specimen from
which to draw his description of the whole race; satisfied
that, although distinctions may exist in minor details
between it and others of its species, the general characteristics
will be found alike in all.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to sketch the principal incidents in
the history of a class whose trials seem peculiarly interesting,
because coming at a period of life usually exempted
from them, I have pursued a similar course; and
though the career of my heroine may present features
peculiar to itself, as must ever be the case with personal
history, her experiences will, I believe, be found to differ
in no essential particular from those of the great body of
her sisterhood. It can hardly be deemed necessary perhaps
to begin the biography of the half-boarder from the
hour of her birth; it may be sufficient to state that she
is usually the eldest daughter of parents of the middle
class, depressed into comparative poverty either by misfortune
or imprudence, but blessed with the inalienable
advantage of belonging to 'a good family,' and being enabled
to boast of relatives of consideration in the world.
Her earliest years are too often passed amid all the horrors
of genteel but biting penury; in witnessing, daily, cares
that have become familiarised, though not lightened, to
her by frequent recurrence; and sharing anxieties which,
though studiously concealed from her, experience has
enabled her to divine, without suggesting any means of
alleviating. Her duties are sufficiently multifarious: she
shares the labours of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The little maid some four foot high,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>by taking upon herself the lighter portion of the house
work; and adds to this the heavier burthens of unremitting
attendance on an ailing mother, and constant endeavours
to divert the anxieties of a careworn father. She
is the governess of such of her half-dozen brothers and
sisters as are old enough to profit by her instruction, enlightening
them with such gleams of knowledge as her
own limited opportunities may have enabled her to acquire;
and is at the same time the playmate and nurse
of the younger members of her family. Thus matters
usually stand until our heroine is about fourteen years
old, when some pressing emergency induces the wife, notwithstanding
her own repugnance, and the strong discouragement
of her husband, to apply to his family for
pecuniary assistance. The welldoing uncles or cousins,
though at first astonished at the assurance of the world
in general, and their own poor relation in particular, are
not more hardhearted than is usual with persons who
have all their lives enjoyed an uninterrupted tide of prosperity,
and a family council is therefore held to consider
what should be done in the matter. It is agreed at
once, without a dissentient voice, that any pecuniary advances
would be entirely out of the question; that they
would only patch matters for a time, without being of
any permanent service to the family; and, what is not
the least objection, might afford an inconvenient precedent
for similar applications in future emergencies: and it is
finally determined that the aid which will prove eventually
of most service to the family, at the least cost to
themselves, may be afforded by assuming the charge of
the education of the eldest child. The matron of the
conclave is therefore deputed to make known to the applicant
that, although they feel themselves precluded
from complying with the specific request contained in her
letter, yet that, being desirous of serving her family in
consideration of the blood relationship subsisting between
her husband and themselves, they have determined on
relieving her from the burthen of Maria's education.</p>

<p>The first feeling of the anxious circle on the receipt
of this announcement is one of unmixed disappointment.
The father had not been without hopes of the success of
the application, though he professes that the result is just
what he had expected from the beginning. Maria is but
young, and her education at this precise period is comparatively
unimportant, while he is convinced that a
compliance with the original request would have relieved
him from all difficulty, and have enabled him satisfactorily
to provide himself for his children's education; while
the mother, though by no means so sanguine on this head,
has nevertheless her own cause of disappointment in the
cold and measured tone of the communication, which she
feels with all the sensitiveness of misfortune. The matter,
however, is talked over in all its bearings, and by
degrees a brighter light seems to break in upon them.</p>

<p>The father begins to consider that, although the aid
offered is not precisely that which he desired, it is nevertheless
an important assistance; and the mother soon
loses sight of the affront to her own <i>amour propre</i> in the
chilling tone in which the favour is proffered, when she
thinks of the advantages it promises to her child. Both
parents remember having noticed particularly the young
ladies of Miss Wilson's establishment at church, their
superior gentility both of appearance and deportment,
and forthwith follows a bright daydream on the advantage
of Maria's becoming a day-boarder at that establishment&mdash;thus
securing the double benefit of the good
education for herself, without losing the advantage of the
evening instruction for her sisters, and the solace of her
society to them all. A letter of thanks for the consideration
of the uncle or cousin is cheerfully penned, a card
of the terms of Miss Wilson's school is procured and
enclosed, and, for one entire evening, the whole family
rejoice together in the midst of their cares at this stroke
of good-fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span></p>

<p>For a whole week no reply is vouchsafed to the letter,
and they begin to feel anxious lest some stray word or
unconsidered sentence should have given offence to the
persons they are most interested in conciliating. At
length, however, they are relieved on this head: a brief
note arrives, in which the writer regrets that they cannot
fall into the plan sketched out by the parents; but as
their motive in consenting to undertake the charge of the
child at all, is to give her the means of securing her own
livelihood in a respectable manner, they are of opinion
that that object will be best attained by removing her
altogether from her own family, and placing her as half-boarder,
for a term of years, in some well-known school,
for which they are already on the look-out. The letter
concludes by professing, with extreme humility, that
should this arrangement not coincide with the parents'
views, they would by no means desire its adoption; in
which case, however, it is very clearly intimated, they
would of course feel themselves relieved from any further
responsibility in the matter.</p>

<p>The dictatorial tone and startling brevity of this communication
fall like an ice-bolt on the assembled group.
The first impulse of the father is to reject the offer altogether;
but when he looks on the anxious countenance
of his child, he feels that he has no right to sacrifice her
permanent benefit to a mere consideration of feeling on
his own part. He accordingly smothers his resentment
at the manner in which the boon is offered, and tries to
rejoice that the comforts of a respectable home, and freedom
from home cares and menial drudgery, are by any
means secured to his child.</p>

<p>An anxious consultation next ensues on the subject of
her outfit: the family wardrobe is produced in the little
parlour; the least mended of the under-garments are
selected, and a clean white tucker is appended to the
well-worn best frock; the Sunday bonnet is relined with
an eighteenpenny sarsnet, and retrimmed with a threepenny
ribbon; the cost of half-a-dozen home-made muslin
collars is calculated; and the propriety of a new merino
frock is finally canvassed and determined on. The father
looks on with an aching heart and a moistened eye as
the last article of absolute necessity is provided for by a
cheerful surrender, on the part of the mother, of her own
squirrel boa and scarlet shawl.</p>

<p>A few days elapse, during which our heroine endeavours
to soften the loss her absence will occasion in the household
by redoubled diligence on her own part. The fortnight's
wash is anticipated by a few days; she works
early and late to mend up all the stockings; the children
are doubly tasked on the score of lessons; the sister next
in age to herself is enjoined to be very attentive to poor
mamma, and the younger children to render due obedience
to her deputy. On the evening of the Saturday following
the father brings home a letter from his munificent
relative, announcing that a school having been found
for the child, she is to repair, on the Monday following,
by Dawney's Wimbleton Coach, where a place for her has
been taken and paid for, to their country-house; and
intimating that it will not be necessary for the father
to be at the trouble of accompanying her himself, as her
safety has been secured by an order already issued to the
gardener to be in attendance at the end of the avenue on
the arrival of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The intervening Sunday is a day of restless anxiety to
the whole family. Advice on the minutest particular
of her future conduct is affectionately bestowed on our
heroine. A faint attempt at cheerfulness is maintained
by the whole circle, till the arrival of night and darkness
permits each individual to give free vent to the pent-up
feelings by an unrestrained burst of tears. The heart
thus lightened of its load, they sleep calmly, and rise
in the morning of separation conscious of a feeling of
hope and cheerfulness, to which anxiety has kept them
strangers since the first opening of the important negotiation.</p>

<p>The middle of Monday sees our heroine, for the first
time in her life, surrounded by all the refinements of a
well-appointed English gentleman's household. On her
arrival she is conducted to the school-room of her young
cousins, where she joins the party at dinner, and undergoes
a somewhat unceremonious scrutiny on the part of
the young ladies. They are good-natured, thoughtless
girls, however; and though they do not fail to remark
that her hands are rather coarse, and that she wants the
self-possession of a lady, the circumstance is noted to
each other in a carefully-subdued tone, and does not in
anyway influence their kindly dispositions towards her.
They exhibit, by way of amusing her, their toys and
trinkets, and question her of her own possessions and
attainments; but meeting with little response on this
head, they try another resource, and considerately propose
some merry game. The young novice, alas, has never
had time to play! but she feels their kindness, and does
her best to participate in the gaiety around her. The
lady-mother returns from her drive barely in time to
dress for dinner; and thus the awful period of introduction
to her is deferred until the accustomed hour of
dessert summons the denizens of the school-room and
nursery to the dining-room.</p>

<p>I wish that truth would enable me to endow my
heroine with that best letter of introduction&mdash;personal
beauty; but what girl of her age was ever even pretty?
The beautiful roundness of the features of childhood is past,
and the skeleton only of womanhood has succeeded it:
hence the falling-in chest, the long, thin arms, the bony
ankles, the squareness of figure, and, above all, the vacant
or anxious school-girl face. It is utterly impossible to conjure
up beauty out of such materials; they belong less to
the individual than to the age, and nothing short of time
itself can remedy the evil. But when, to such disadvantages,
a frightened awkwardness of manner is superadded, as in
the present instance, by the unaccustomed appearance
of everything around, and the consciousness of a dubious
position, it is hardly to be expected that the result could
be of a nature greatly to conciliate the favour of an indifferent,
not to say prejudiced, spectator; and the reader,
therefore, will not be surprised to learn that a reception
perfectly civil, though rather cold, is all that awaits the
protégée in the halls of her benefactors. The hostess fills
her plate with fruit, and the host, without asking her
consent, adds a glass of wine; and then both turn to
listen to the wit of their own offspring, and talk over the
events of the day. In the course of some half-an-hour
the gentleman exhibits signs of an inclination to take his
siesta, and the rest of the party adjourn to the drawing-room,
where a confidential conversation ensues between
madam and the resident governess, in reference, apparently,
to the dependent child, who, with the quick
instinct of inborn propriety, retreats towards the other
end of the room, where she endeavours to amuse the
younger children; in which she is so eminently successful,
that the stately manner of the lady gradually begins to
relax. Previously to the arrival of coffee, she is heard to
request some trifling service at the hands of her little
relative; and before the conclusion of the evening, finds
herself even addressing the child as 'my dear!' The
rest of the circle take their cue from the lady-in-chief;
and the young stranger, by degrees, feels herself on a
footing of intimacy almost approaching to equality.</p>

<p>With the earliest dawn our heroine is wide awake, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
unaccustomed luxury of down pillows having, she thinks,
prevented her from sleeping well. She wonders whether
they are thinking of her at home, and how her sister performed
her new duties; and ponders with some anxiety
on her own future lot. Her father's relations have been
very kind to her, far more kind, indeed, than she had
expected; and she does not despair for the future. She
is, however, rather annoyed at being obliged to admit the
assistance of a servant in dressing her, and rejoices when
the morning salutation with her cousins is over. However,
a walk round the extensive grounds tends somewhat
to brace up her nerves; and she receives a personal summons
to attend her benefactress in her dressing-room
without experiencing any serious trepidation. On her
arrival in this sanctum she is desired to take a seat, and
has to undergo a rather minute cross-examination as to
her personal attainments, as well as in regard to her late
habits and occupations. Her replies elicit no further
remark than a caution, not harshly given, against bestowing
any unnecessary confidences on these points upon
the lady, her future governess, and the companions of her
future home; whereof the advantages are forcibly pointed
out to her, and a due appreciation of their benefits earnestly
enjoined. Then follows the expression of a confident
hope on the part of her monitor that the great
expense incurred to secure for her all these benefits will
be met by proportionate exertions on her part to profit to
the very utmost by the advantages thus generously placed
within her reach. This exordium brought to a close, and
a dutiful acknowledgment returned thereto, she is next
interrogated as to the extent and quality of her wardrobe,
and replies with cheerful alacrity that she is well provided
for on that score; but whether a hint dropped to
the governess by the under-housemaid of the result of her
observations at her toilet may have suggested a doubt on
this head, or whether a feeling of curiosity is entertained
by the lady as to what is considered a good provision by
a poor relation, is uncertain, but the poor girl is required
to produce the wardrobe, the extent of which does not
preclude her from fulfilling the mandate in person. The
carpet-bag is brought down, and hastily opened, and, with
an involuntary gesture of distaste, as hastily closed. The
services of the maid of the young ladies are in instant requisition,
and an order is given to her to make a selection
of the more ordinary garments from the wardrobes of her
young mistresses. The damsel, though by no means approving
of this wholesale appropriation of what she has
been accustomed to regard as her own ultimate property,
obeys her instructions, and soon returns with an ample
supply of half-worn garments, which, with an air of subdued
sullenness, she places before her mistress. The lady,
who fathoms at once the origin of her dissatisfaction,
desires her, in a voice of some asperity, instantly to pack
them up; and secures a more cheerful compliance with
the mandate by an intimation that compensation will
be made to her in another way. These preliminaries
adjusted, luncheon and the carriage are ordered to be
in readiness an hour before their usual time; the lady
announces her intention of personally introducing her
protégée to her new home; and then intimates that her
presence may for the present be dispensed with.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed the carriage is announced, the
lady sweeps in, followed by her young relative, and an
hour's drive brings them to the end of their journey. The
aristocratic peal of the footman remains unanswered for a
period sufficiently long to admit of a brief investigation
of our heroine's future home. It is a large, red brick
house, old fashioned, but perfectly respectable in appearance,
with a multiplicity of windows, carefully veiled by
blinds from top to bottom. A small front garden intervenes
between the house and the public road, and is surrounded
by a low brick wall, surmounted by a lofty hedge
of laurustinas, under which blooms a perpetual growth of
the blue periwinkle. The box-edges of the parterres are
more than usually luxuriant, and the gravel walk, though
carefully swept, presents visible signs of the moss of ages.
The brass-plate on the outer gate, and the ample steps
leading into the house, are scrupulously clean. On either
side of the entrance hall, which is spacious, and even
handsome, stand two large professional-looking globes,
appropriate introductions to the world of knowledge beyond;
while from the centre branches off a square flight
of broad, well-carpeted oak stairs, which, if any criterion
of the size of the rooms above, promise well for the
domestic comfort of the establishment.</p>

<p>In the absence of a footman&mdash;a functionary not admissible
in a seminary for young ladies&mdash;the party is conducted
by a smart parlour-maid to a well-proportioned,
though somewhat chilly drawing-room, handsomely furnished
with chairs, guarded from use as carefully as 'the
throne' of Lady Margaret Bellenden at Tillietudlem,
and footstools which, though preserved by oil-silk covers,
are yet guiltless of ever having been pressed by the foot
of human being. The chimneypiece exhibits hand-screens
as smart as gold paper and water-colours can make them,
in which the conflicting styles of the pupil and the
master, though ingeniously blended, are easily to be distinguished;
and on the principal table stands a valuable
work-box, which the lady of the house will not fail incidentally
to remark was a present to her from her affectionate
pupils. The room, in short, is redolent of professional
decorations, from the Berlin wool and embroidery
of the present day, to the bygone glories of filigree and
shellwork. The visitors have only time to look around
them, and select two chairs upon which they can sit with
a good conscience, before the mistress of the house presents
herself in the person of a very upright, ladylike
woman, attired in black silk of glossy freshness, and
leading by the hand a beautiful little girl, the pride
of the school. The child (who is exquisitely dressed for
exhibition) has been committed to her charge by its doting
parents the day before they sailed for India, and she
cannot, therefore, persuade herself to lose sight of her for
an instant. This is said by way of apology; and the little
piece of sentimentalism having produced its desired effect,
the child is quietly dismissed to amuse herself at the
other end of the room.</p>

<p>The important subject of terms and length of engagement
having been adjusted at a previous interview, the
patroness has little to do beyond introducing the new
pupil to her new protector; and the identity of the
family name unhappily preventing her début as the
orphan child of a deceased schoolfellow, no alternative
remains but to name her as Miss Maria Armstrong, a
young person in whose welfare she feels a lively interest,
the young lady being, in fact, a distant relative of Mr
Armstrong himself, the offspring, she is sorry to add, of
an imprudent marriage. How far her education may
already have proceeded, the lady has had no means of
ascertaining, never having seen any member of the family
until the previous evening. She, however, without solicitude,
confides the child to her maternal care, in the
fullest confidence that whatever talents she may possess
will receive the highest culture at her hands, and in the
hope that the same will be met by a corresponding degree
of diligence on the part of the young person herself, as on
the exercise of these talents, be they great or small, her
future wellbeing must depend. The lady believes that
every necessary for the use of one in the position of her
protégée has been provided; but should anything indispensable
have been forgotten, she begs Mrs Sharp will
have the goodness to procure it. She has only further to
request, that no unnecessary intercourse with her own
family may be encouraged on the part of the child; such
communications, if of frequent occurrence, having a very
obvious tendency to unsettle the mind, and unfit it for
its manifold duties. With these sentiments Mrs Sharp
entirely coincides. The lady rises, bestows a kiss on the
little fairy&mdash;a shake of the hand and half-a-guinea on the
young dependent&mdash;and a bow expressive of mingled cordiality
and condescension on the mistress of the house&mdash;and
then, with a measured step, regains her equipage;
and, as the nursery rhyme has it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The carriage drives off with a bound.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the new-comer is only a half-boarder, it cannot of
course be expected that the head of an establishment of
pretensions equal to the one of which we are speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
should herself introduce the stranger to her dormitory;
and as the attendance of a housemaid might lead to unwarrantable
expectations of future service, the little girl
is deputed to convoy Miss Armstrong to the room over
the kitchen, the left-hand closet of which will be found
vacant for the reception of her clothes. When this is
accomplished, should any time remain previously to the
tea-bell, she had better inform herself of the names and
localities of the various departments, with which her
little guide will have pleasure in making her acquainted.
The clothes are unpacked, and put away, and the tour of
the house is hardly accomplished when the expected peal
is rung. A rustling sound, accompanied by the shuffling
of many feet, is heard in the distance; the little girl
safely pilots her companion to the parlour door, leaving
her to make her <i>entrée</i> alone, and then skips off to join
her companions in the refectory. The young novice waits a
few moments to gather both breath and courage, and then
gently taps at the door; a voice from within desires her to
enter, and she stands before half-a-dozen smart ladies at
tea. A pause of a moment succeeds, which is broken
by the governess, who thinks (aloud) that it will perhaps
be the best plan for Miss Armstrong at once to enter
upon her duties. She is therefore desired to proceed
along the passage till she arrives at a green baize door,
on opening which, a second door will introduce her to the
apartments of the young ladies. She makes her exit
from the parlour in the best manner she is able, and
experiences but little difficulty in discovering the eating-room,
from which issues a cheerful buzz of voices. She
wisely resolves not to give her courage time to cool, and
so enters without observing the preliminary ceremony of
self-announcement. The sound of the opening door produces
an instantaneous hush, and at the same time directs
towards her the glance of four-and-twenty pair of curious
eyes, besides a piercingly-black individual pair appertaining
to the French governess at the head of the table.
She stands perfectly astonished at her own temerity; then
thankfully sinks into a chair pointed out by that lady on
her left hand; accepts a cup of tea, which a choking sensation
in the throat prevents her from swallowing, and is
conscious of an unwilling suffusion of colour from the
crown of her head to her very fingers' ends. Tea and the
tea things at length despatched, the usual half hour
supervenes previously to the period for preparing lessons,
advantage of which is taken by madame to inquire the
name, age, &amp;c. of the new-comer; whilst the little
figurante, whose position renders her a sort of <i>avant-courier</i>
to the school-room of the proceedings in the
drawing-room, is captured by one of the elder girls, who,
on pretence of plaiting her hair, seats her on her knee in
the midst of her own peculiar set, and proceeds to extract,
with very commendable ingenuity, all the events
of the day, reserving to herself the liberty of drawing her
own inferences from the detail, copious or meagre, as the
case may be. One circumstance connected with the
arrival of the young stranger does strike the privileged
set with inexpressible astonishment. If, as is asserted,
she came in a private carriage, and that carriage the
veritable property of her friends, and not a 'trumpery
glass-coach'&mdash;how, then, could she be going to sleep in
the room over the kitchen?&mdash;that chamber of Blue-Beard
reputation, strongly suspected of harbouring mice, and
convicted, beyond question, of being subject to a very
disagreeable odour! The thing is pronounced impossible,
and unworthy a moment's credit. In vain the
child assures them, upon her word and honour, she helped
to put away her clothes; the proposition is not to be believed
for an instant. The informant, indignant at having
her veracity impeached, calls aloud on Miss Armstrong
to verify her assertion. The appeal is, however,
happily overpowered by a simultaneous shuffle of the
feet of the inquisitors; she is quietly slided from the knee
on which she had been sitting, and the discussion proceeds
in the absence of the witness. There certainly is
something very unusual attending the new-comer: no
note of preparation announced her advent; no cheerful
congratulations had been offered to themselves on the
prospect of a new companion; no hopes expressed that
they would do their best to make her home a pleasant
one. And then the circumstance of her taking her <i>first</i>
tea in the eating-room, to which she was not even introduced;
such a mark of contumely had never before been
suffered within the memory of the oldest school-girl present;
and of this fact they were themselves eye-witnesses.
It was inexplicable: they could not understand it. A
single hour, however, suffices to solve the mystery: the
period at length arrives for preparing lessons, and with it
the housemaid to curl the hair of the younger children;
and in this labour of love Miss Armstrong is requested to
lend her assistance! A glimmering light as to her real
position flashes across the minds of the bewildered spectators.
But when she is further required to attend the
children to their respective rooms, and light the candles
preparatory to the arrival of the elder girls, the matter
is put beyond a doubt: she is&mdash;she must be&mdash;a half-boarder!</p>

<p>Reader, picture to yourself, I beseech you, the estimation
in which a Christian slave is held by a follower of
the true Prophet, a Nazarene by a Jewish rabbi, a Pariah
by a holy Brahmin of immaculate descent, and you may
then have some faint, some very faint idea, of the depths
to which this fact has sunk our heroine in the estimation
of the major part of her schoolfellows!</p>

<p>The young ladies are at length fairly disposed of for
the night; and the half-boarder, having completed her
duties, descends again to the school-room, which she finds
in the possession of the housemaid and a cloud of dust,
the French teacher having joined the party in the parlour.
Thither she also repairs, and requests permission
to retire to her room. The concession is readily granted
to her, and she gladly seeks her bed, to sleep with what
soundness of repose she may. Anxious to fulfil the duties
of her post to the spirit as well as to the letter of the
bond, she is dressed even before the school-bell rings, and
is ready on its summons to assist in the ablutions of the
little ones. She saves many a heedless chit a fine by
herself folding up the forgotten night-clothes; an indulgence,
however, not to be taken as a precedent, her duty
being to aid in the reformation of evil habits, not to
slur them over. Having had no lessons marked out for
her on this first morning, she watches the order of proceedings,
and helps the little favourite to master the
difficulties of a column of spelling.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the pupils having dispersed themselves
in the garden to taste the morning air (young ladies
have no playground), the half-boarder has a private
audience of the superior, in order that, her mental standing
having been duly ascertained, she may be drafted
into class second or third, as the case may be. After rendering
a true and particular account of her acquirements
in reading, writing, needlework, &amp;c. &amp;c. and admitted
her total ignorance of French, music, and dancing, the
order is given for her admission into the third class, and
beginning French forthwith. Dancing and music are
held out as stimulants to quicken her diligence in making
herself 'generally useful,' in consideration of having
been received into the establishment at one-half the
usual charge. Her duties cannot very clearly be defined,
but she will soon comprehend them. Soon, indeed, poor
girl! they being, in fact, to do all that is neglected to
be performed by the other members of the household&mdash;to
stand in the alternate relations of nursemaid and instructress
of the younger children, and of butt and fag to the
elder ones. She must be prepared to consider herself the
link between the lower teacher and the upper servant,
willing to lend her aid to each, and to bear the blame
due to either; to labour with untiring diligence to improve
her mind and increase her accomplishments, and
thus eventually supersede the necessity for an under
teacher at all.</p>

<p>These are multifarious duties, it must be admitted; but,
as Dr Johnson says, 'few things are impossible to ingenuity
and perseverance.' She has not been brought up
in the lap of refinement, and therefore misses not its
comforts: she is blessed with a strong constitution and
a willing mind, loves learning for its own sake, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
forgets that every member of her own family may be
ultimately benefited through her means.</p>

<p>It is true that at first it is painful to stand up with
the little class&mdash;herself a giant among pigmies; to be
conscious of a sneering smile on the part of the teacher
as she draws a parallel between her bodily height and
her dwarfish information. It is mortifying to know that
her dresses have been discovered, by their misfit, to have
belonged to other parties&mdash;that the discrepancies between
her own initials and those on her linen have not been
overlooked&mdash;and to feel that the absence of a weekly
allowance, and regular home correspondence, are never-failing
sources of unsympathising wonder.</p>

<p>All this is mortifying enough, but it is not all she has
to undergo. After rising early, and lying down late, and
eating the bread of carefulness, she finds that even the
rigid performance of her own duties, and the neglected
work of half-a-dozen people besides, meets at first with
but little encouragement from the mistress of the house,
who receives it purely as a matter of course, while it does
not fail to awaken the distrust and jealousy of her subordinates.
The cook remembers her refusal to connive at
the abstraction of 'a dust of tea,' even when the key of
the storeroom was actually in her hand; and the housemaid
bears in mind that Miss Johnson would have bestowed
upon her her last year's cloak on the arrival of her
new <i>visite</i>, had not the half-boarder suggested the necessity
for asking leave. The French teacher does not forget
that, on the only occasion in which she indulged in a
little harmless flirtation with a whiskered cousin of her
own, the half-boarder looked reproof; the English teacher
remembers her refusal furtively to procure sundry little
delicacies not included in the daily bill of fare; while
her assistant notes her strenuous efforts to qualify herself
to supersede her in her own department.</p>

<p>All these offences are registered and retaliated. The
cook, when reproved for any omission, stoutly declares that
orders transmitted through Miss Armstrong never reach
her; the housemaid, in waiting at table, contrives that
the least savoury <i>plat</i> shall fall to her lot; the Parisienne
shrugs her shoulders as she comments on her air <i>bourgeois</i>;
the English teacher frankly declares she never
could like her; whilst her subordinate sister 'hopes' that
Miss Armstrong may prove as simple as she appears.</p>

<p>But a Sacred Authority has assured us that though
sorrow may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning;
and the experience even of a half-boarder demonstrates
that a patient continuance in welldoing is not
without its reward. By degrees the lot of our heroine is
considerably ameliorated: the prejudice against her begins
to wear away; and even the English teacher, who
has held out the longest, having a character for consistency
to maintain, is constrained to admit that Miss
Armstrong is an estimable and well-conducted young
person. Her desire to please is at length appreciated,
and her poverty is even admitted to be rather her misfortune
than her fault. The great girls cease to despise her&mdash;the
little girls learn to love her. The higher powers
readily second the exertions for self-improvement which
promise to relieve them from the drudgery of initiatory
instruction; and the prize held out for the successful
fulfilment of her humbler duties is in process of time
secured. Instruction in dancing and music commences
with the second half year, and glimmerings of still greater
glories are pointed out in the distance.</p>

<p>The governess, though an exacting, is not an unjust
taskmistress. If she requires much during school-hours,
she allows the unusual luxuries of fire and lights when
school duty is over; and furthermore advances the interests
of her pupil by a statement, under her own hand,
to the benefactress of the half-boarder, that she promises
to do honour to that lady's patronage no less than to her
own establishment.</p>

<p>Her successful progress in the road to learning, and
in the good graces of those around her, coupled with the
encouragement afforded by a kind word, and now and
then a small present bestowed on her by the grateful
mamma of some infant prodigy, all combine to quicken
her steps in the race towards the grand object of her
ambition&mdash;the qualifying herself for the situation of a
nursery governess. In the meantime, in the words of
Crabbe, her duty is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">&mdash;&mdash;'to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dependent helper always at the wheel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her power minute, her compensation small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her labours great, her life laborious all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set after set the lower tribe to make<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Doorkeeper she at Learning's lower gate.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is her lot for some two years; but she has the encouragement
of knowing that her apprenticeship, though
a hard one, is gradually fitting her for the object of her
ambition; while, as she advances in her career, the experience
of the past inspires her with confidence for the
future, since it proves to her that right principle and
steady perseverance are invincible, or they could never
have enabled her to overcome the trials and difficulties
which beset the path of a Half-Boarder.</p>

<h2><a name="INDIAN_POLICE_REVELATIONS" id="INDIAN_POLICE_REVELATIONS">INDIAN POLICE REVELATIONS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have frequently had occasion to observe that travellers
differ widely from each other, even as to such
matters of fact as must have come under the cognisance
of their senses. The late Mr Rae Wilson, for instance,
who observed personally the falls of the Narova, gives
the measurement of the descent of water at something
so comparatively enormous, as to prove that he had
unconsciously blended in his imagination the whole of
the rapids into one cataract; and we ourselves, when
gazing upon those troubled waters from the wooden
bridge that spans them, looked with such surprise upon
the 'Yarrow Visited,' as must, we fear, have coloured,
in an opposite way from Mr Wilson's, our impressions,
and consequently our report. If travellers who desire,
both from interest and inclination, to be impartial differ
so widely in matters of fact, what shall be said of matters
of opinion? A compiler is frequently taunted with
presuming to write critically of countries he has never
visited in person; but if he will only take the pains to
collect, and sift, and compare the jarring and often
opposite accounts of residents and travellers, we have
a strong suspicion that he will be found better qualified
for his business than any of them!</p>

<p>India has always been <i>the</i> Debateable Land of authors,
both as to fact and opinion. The books published upon
that country contain the most outrageous mass of contradictions
extant; and each successive writer gives the
lie, without the smallest ceremony, to those who preceded
him. This cannot be wholly owing to our ignorance
of the country and the people. The Hon. Robert
Lindsay was shut up with the natives almost exclusively
for twelve years; and he represents them as
being so honest, that he could intrust three or four
thousand pounds' worth of his property to a menial
servant, wandering to the farthest extremity of the
country, and absent for twelve months at a time.
Colonel Davidson resided for many years, and travelled
much in India; and he turns the reverse of the medal,
representing the native inhabitants as thieves and vagabonds
to a man. We must go further, therefore, than
the mere question of knowledge; for these two witnesses
(whom we take as the types of two numerous
classes) are men of both knowledge and honour. We
must seek for an explanation of the mystery in the
depths of the human character.</p>

<p>The colour of an object, although really one of its
inherent properties, is always modified by the medium
through which it is seen; and nothing but care and
reflection, or at least lengthened experience, will enable
us to correct the error, and trace the actual through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
apparent hue. In the same way, the qualities of a
people in one stage of civilisation cannot be judged of
intuitively by a people in another stage, because they
are viewed through an uncongenial medium. The
Indians can no more be comprehended at once by Europeans,
than Europeans can be comprehended at once by
the Indians. Much care will be required to enable the
two to arrive even at an approximation to a true
understanding of each other. Virtue and vice are not
the substantive and unbending terms we commonly
imagine them to be. They receive a new meaning, or
a new force, in every new form of civilisation; the <i>lex
talionis</i> of the ancient Jews, for instance, was abrogated
by the more advanced law of Christianity; and we
meet with a hundred things in history&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Things light or lovely in their acted time'&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, in the present day, would be considered indications
of positive depravity. Few of the heroes of the
middle ages would escape hanging or the hulks in the
nineteenth century, and fewer still of the heroines
would be received in a modern drawing-room!</p>

<p>To form a correct estimate of the Indians, we must
compare them with other Asiatic nations, and not with
the inhabitants of Europe, where the human character
received a new and extraordinary development
through the collision of different and distant races of
mankind. According to the former standard, the Indians
are much in advance, which can only be accounted for by
the vast extent of their country, and the fluctuating
movements of its population, interrupting in some degree
what is called the 'permanent' form of civilisation peculiar
to Asia. To estimate their moral and social prospects,
however, and the moral and social prospects of the
Eastern world in general, we must compare them with
our own ancestors of a few centuries ago, among whom
we shall find quite as much grossness of taste, obtuseness
of feeling, tyranny, dishonesty, antagonism of classes, and
puerile and debasing superstition. The conflicting views
of the Indian character arise simply from the opposite
idiosyncrasies of the observers. Colonel Davidson finds
theft common, and stigmatises the people with the
English name of thieves; while Mr Lindsay, marvelling
at the singular fidelity of his servants, ascribes to
them the English virtue of honesty. Both are deceived;
for these two apparently opposite qualities may, and do,
meet in the same individuals, and are therefore not of
the nature of the English qualities of the same name.
If we encountered such passages in history, we should
comprehend the seeming anomaly, and at once refer
it to a particular stage of civilisation; but falling in
with them in the course of our personal experience, and
suffering from the bad, or deriving advantage from the
good quality, we take no care to discriminate, but give
praise or blame according to the religious and moral
dispensation we live under in Europe. The tendency
of this want of discrimination is adverse to Indian progress.
The people are at this moment undergoing, but
more slowly, the change which revolutionised the West;
although this time Mohammed goes to the mountain,
since the mountain does not come to Mohammed. Europe
flings itself upon Asia, and Western knowledge
ferments in the inert mass of Eastern ignorance. We
are numerically few, however, though intellectually
powerful; and it is of the utmost consequence that we
should comprehend clearly what we are about, so that
our efforts towards the advancement of those we have
taken forcibly under our tutelage should proceed in the
right direction.</p>

<p>We have been led into these reflections by a very
slight matter&mdash;a little book, as coarse, vulgar, and
tasteless as can well be imagined; which professes to
be the revelations of an orderly, or police subordinate,
attached to an Anglo-Indian provincial court.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> According
to this authority, all India would appear to be
one bloated mass of crime and tumult, and the calm and
beautiful pictures of such writers as Sleeman would
therefore require to be set down as impudent fabrications.
But we do not look for an account of English manners
in the Newgate Calendar; and the native scribe
who in this little book withdraws the curtain from the
mysteries of Indian police may be thanked for his contribution,
partial as it is, to our knowledge of the country.
In fact it is impossible to talk with too much
reprobation of the police system of India. In venality
and oppression it was never surpassed even by the
most corrupt nations either of the East or the West,
either in ancient or modern times. The reason is, that
an effective police must be spread like a network over
the whole country, and the Europeans are far too few
for reasonable superintendence. Old abuses thus remain
unchecked, and vast multitudes of hereditary
scoundrels combine to cheat their superiors and oppress
the people. The police, in fact, are the objects
of universal dread; and numberless crimes escape unpunished,
and even unexposed, because their victims
will rather suffer than invoke such fatal assistance.</p>

<p>At present, however, our business is more with the
criminal than the policeman; and the rough pictures
of our Orderly show that the peculiarity of Indian crime
is its resemblance to the crime of old and modern
Europe at the same time. We see in it, under Indian
characteristics, the offences of mediæval Europe, extravagantly
combined with those of our own day. The
priestly transgressors of the dark ages are reproduced
in the Pundahs and Poojarees of Benares; and the
English swindler who takes a handsome house, and victimises
the neighbouring tradesmen, has an Indian
brother in the <i>soi-disant</i> rajah, who confers his patronage
as a prodigious favour.</p>

<p>The priests, it seems, perpetrate all sorts of crimes
with perfect impunity. 'Many a dark deed has been
done, and is done, in the extensive houses of these
Pundahs and Poojarees. While the gong is loudly
sounding, and scores of athletic priests are blowing
<i>sunkhs</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in the numerous temples that are dotted
about and around the houses, the last expiring shriek
of some victim is perhaps suppressed by the noise.
Disobedient <i>chelas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> victims of jealousy and crime,
die by slow torture, or poison, or famine. No intimation
is, or can be, given to the police, for none
but the initiated and privileged may enter these
houses, sanctified by the numerous temples. And who
but the most devoted and trustworthy are ever permitted
to see the dark places where crime is committed?
It is believed generally&mdash;but I speak not
from experience (for being of the faith of Islam, I am
not permitted to approach such places)&mdash;that in the
innermost recesses of several temples is a shrine devoted
to "Devee," or "Bhowanee;" those infernal
deities whose delight is in blood, where children of
tender age are enticed, and offered up on certain
occasions. Frequent are the reports made to the
police that children are missing; the informants suspect
nobody, and no trace of the innocents is ever
found.'</p>

<p>Another pest are the <i>dullals</i> (brokers), who haunt the
markets, and levy a handsome per-centage on everything
that is bought and sold. 'Go into the <i>chouk</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and attempt
to purchase the most trivial article: take up a pair of
shoes, or a shawl, and you will find a <i>dullal</i> at your
elbow. The man praises one thing, abuses another, beats
down the price of the vender authoritatively; and you
are surprised that such disinterested officiousness should
be shown to a stranger in a crowded chouk. The man
civilly offers to take you whithersoever you please,
and to assist you in purchasing whatever you may
require. You return home, wondering what was the
man's inducement to waste his own time in chaffering
for you. I lift the curtain to show you that the venders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
and your <i>chaperone</i> are in league; that your complaisant
friend is a dullal, who takes very good care to
lower the vender's price only so much as to admit of
his coming in for a handsome <i>dusturee</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The difference
between the bazaar price and the amount price of the
article sold is the <i>huq</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the dullal. You will ask
whether the vender may not himself pocket the whole
of the money? I answer that he dare not. The whole
of the dullals would cabal against him; would cry
down his wares; would thrash him within an inch of
his life; would by force prevent purchasers from attending
his shop. Can such things be? you ask. Can the
authorities submit tamely to such outrages? Why do
not the parties who are cheated or bullied complain to
the magistrate? They have tried the experiment; and
although in a few instances successful, they have generally
failed in obtaining redress from want of judicial
proof. Moral conviction is one thing, and judicial proof
another. And were a magistrate to punish on moral
conviction alone, his judgment would in all probability
be reversed by the judge in appeal; who, having to
form his judgment by the written evidence, must be
guided by judicial proof alone.'</p>

<p>The <i>Budmashes</i> practise a trick that is not unknown
in England, although known there chiefly under the
modification of bills of Exchange obtained from the
unwary by means of advertisements in the newspapers.
'Another common trick of the Budmashes is to entice
people of decent condition into their private houses
with seductive solicitations; and after amusing them,
to keep them there until they put their names to
papers, just by way of showing specimens of their autographs.
They have documents ready cut and dry on
stamp papers of different value, duly witnessed by
people who are in their pay, or who participate in their
frauds, to be converted into penal bonds for value received.
Months afterwards the unfortunate visitor is
accosted in any public place, in the presence of numerous
witnesses, and asked for the amount of his (extorted)
bond. Of course the debt is denied, and the
demander is cursed only for his pains. But the Budmash
calls people to witness that he did ask his debtor
to pay the amount of his bond, which he refused to
discharge. An action for debt is instituted. The Budmash
produces the bond before the <i>Moonsiff</i>. The witnesses
are summoned, and are merely asked, "Did you
witness this <i>tumassook</i>?" "I did, your worship," is the
reply: "this is my signature." The witnesses before
whom the Budmash demanded the amount of the bond
also confirm the plaintiff's allegation. The defendant
can only deny the claim, and submit that the bond was
extorted. "Where is the proof?" says the Moonsiff.
"I have none," is the reply. And a decree is given in
favour of plaintiff with costs. It is only when "Greek
meets Greek" that the result is different. Then the
defendant acknowledges the deed, but alleges that he
has paid the amount with interest; and files a receipt
for the amount of the bond, with interest at twelve per
cent., duly attested by three "credible" witnesses, who
appear before the <i>huzoor</i>, and swear to their signatures,
as well as to having seen the money repaid to the
plaintiff.'</p>

<p>We come now to the swindling rajah, whose proceedings
are almost amusing in their rascality. 'A
common mode of swindling in the city of Kashee, as
practised by the clever Budmashes, is for one of the
party to personate a rajah on a visit of ceremony to the
holy city, while his companions pretend to precede
him, and hire a stately <i>huvelee</i> in Dal-ka-Munduvee,
which they furnish for the nonce. Bulbhuddur Singh
sits in state as Rajah Guchpuch Rae, bedecked in false
gems, and dressed in shawls and <i>kimkhabs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> His
retainers go about the city, and entice shawl-merchants
and jewellers to the rajah's house. They
arrive with costly wares, and eagerly proceed to expose
them; but the rajah turns an indifferent eye upon
them, and declares they are not sufficiently choice for
<i>him</i>. The <i>Soudagurs</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> promise to return next day. In
the meantime the song and dance proceed with fierce
rivalry. Six sets of the best dancing-women exert their
lungs and limbs, and go through every fascinating
movement to delight and amuse Rajah Guchpuch Rae.
"Where is my treasurer?" exclaims the rajah. "Bid
him bestow a largess of 100 <i>ushurfees</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on these soul-enslaving,
terrestrial houries." A retainer, after going
through the farce of a search, respectfully approaches
his highness, and intimates that the treasurer has not
yet arrived. "The <i>nimukharam!</i> <i>behaeyah!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> exclaims
the rajah. "Here, fellows, see that a proper treasurer
be in attendance on the morrow, to whom we shall deliver
our treasure and <i>toshehkhanah</i>."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The rajah enjoys
himself until no longer able to sustain excitement;
and then the <i>Gundrupins</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> retire, and the torches are
extinguished.</p>

<p>'Next day there are several candidates for the honour
of the treasurer's office, who eagerly offer to serve.
"The salary is 200 rupees a month," says the rajah;
"and I hate accounts. Constant attendance and implicit
obedience are all I require." After rejecting some,
his highness fixes upon Lalla Umbeka Sahaee, who receives
a well-worn shawl as a <i>khillut</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and an immense
key. He ventures to ask where the treasury is? and
is told to wait until the <i>huzrut</i> has leisure to show it to
him. In the meantime the rajah suddenly recollects that
he has an immediate occasion for 1000 rupees, and he
shouts out, "Here, Bahadoor, take one thousand rupees
from Lalla Umbeka Sahaee, and give it to Bisheshur
Singh, and be sure to take a receipt for the money.
Tell him it is the price of a ring I bought of him for my
favourite Goolbehar." Bahadoor asks the treasurer for
the money. The poor man looks aghast, and shows a
huge key as all he has received of the rajah's treasure.
But Bahadoor tells him that Rajah Guchpuch Rae never
fails to cut off the ears of a disobedient servant. So
the hint is taken, and Lalla gives an order on his <i>shroff</i>
in the city for the amount; and Bahadoor at once proceeds
to realise the money. As evening approaches,
shawl-merchants and jewellers again appear, and press
their wares on the rajah. They see Lalla Umbeka
Sahaee figuring as treasurer. They are old acquaintance,
and they ask him the amount of Guchpuch Rae's
treasure; in reply to which he simply shows <i>the</i> key,
about a foot in length. The merchants open out their
wares to entice the rajah, but he says he will wait until
all his things arrive. They offer to leave their bundles
for the rajah and his ladies to choose, which is agreed
to with apparent indifference. The song and dance
proceed, as usual, until midnight, when the torches are
extinguished.</p>

<p>'Next morning, what a change has taken place! One
old man is seated at the doorway, dozing over a <i>chillum</i>
of <i>ganjah</i>. No other sign of life is visible in Rajah
Guchpuch Rae's palace. The treasurer arrives first,
opens and rubs his eyes, and asks the old man where
the rajah and his people have gone? He replies that
they decamped before dawn. In due course the Muhajuns,
the jewellers, and birds of song arrive, but nothing
of the rajah is to be found; and smoke-stained walls,
and filth, and litter about the rooms, alone betray that
revelry <i>had been</i> there! The jewellers and Muhajuns
turn in wrath upon Lalla Umbeka Sahaee, and tax him
with having aided to cheat them. They proceed first
to abuse, and then to beat him. In vain the poor man
shows the huge key, and laments his thousand rupees
lost for ever. They drag him to the <i>kotwal</i>, and charge
him with having cheated them; and the defrauded
treasurer remains in durance vile for a week at least,
and gets off at last on proving himself to be one of the
victims of this system of swindling, and after feeing the
police myrmidons pretty roundly.'</p>

<p class='p3'>GOTTENBURG TO CHRISTIANIA.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> six o'clock of the morning of the 4th July, Quist
duly appeared with the carriage at the door of the
Gotha Kellare. It was a dull, cool, drizzling morning,
and I mentally rejoiced in having, against many advices,
resolved upon a vehicle which could afford me
protection from the elements. My baggage being arranged
beside me in the carriage, so that I could readily
command anything I wanted&mdash;one of the greatest of all
comforts in solitary travelling&mdash;I hastily swallowed the
cup of coffee presented to me in my bedroom&mdash;the common
custom of the country&mdash;and was soon on the road
to Christiania. I observed that two hardy little horses
were yoked to the carriage with rope-traces. Beside
Quist, who drove them, sat a man who was to bring
back the cattle, the first of a long series of such persons
whom I was to see in that situation during my journey,
of all varieties of age, from twelve years to threescore,
in all kinds of clothes, from stout <i>wadmaal</i> down to
bare decency. The robust, bulky frame of honest Quist
generally made these people appear like dwarfs by his
side. As we drove rapidly along the swampy plain
surrounding Gottenburg, we met an immense number
of small market-carts, driven by peasant men or women,
or both, generally very lightly laden, and going at a
trot, the people being usually seated on a sort of chair,
perched on elastic beams passing back at an angle from
the beams of the vehicle, so as to give somewhat the
effect of springs. I felt affected at seeing such a multitude
of people engaged in a labour so uneconomical, and
which must consequently remunerate them so ill; for of
course where a man or woman give a day of their own
time, along with a horse's labour, to the business of
selling a single pig or lamb, a few chickens and eggs,
or some such trifling merchandise, the remuneration
must be of the most miserable kind. The poor too often
struggle on in this manner, always busy, as they allege,
often working very hard, and wondering that, with all
their exertions, they make so little, when the plain truth
is, that their labour is so ill-directed, or is so uneconomically
conducted, and in the result of their labours they
consequently do so little for their fellow-creatures, that
their little gains are exactly what is to be expected,
and what is strictly their due. The very best lesson
that we could teach a poor man, with a view to improving
his fortunes, would be that which led him, as
far as possible, to extend his usefulness, to substitute
economical for uneconomical labour, and to concentrate
and divide employments. I beheld, with interest, in
this exhibition of the Swedish peasantry, the first aspect
of an economy out of which it has been the business
of the last hundred years to reform the farming
population of my own country.</p>

<p>At the first station, which we reached in little more
than an hour, the horses which had been ordered were
in waiting, along with a new <i>loon</i> of some kind to take
care of them. The man in charge of the used horses
was then paid at a rate which appeared nearly equivalent
to threepence-halfpenny per English mile. But
something more was needed&mdash;<i>dricka-pinge</i>, or drinks-money,
as Quist called it. In England, something like
half-a-crown would have been expected. In Sweden, a
few skillings&mdash;about twopence of our money&mdash;was given,
and most thankfully received. We then set out with
our new horses. The station, it may be remarked, is a
place like a carrier's inn. Travellers of a humble class
may stop and refresh at it; but it expects no gentlemen
customers, and is unprepared for their reception. One
or two out of a long series are tolerable places, and it is
necessary to calculate so as to have any needful meals
there, instead of the meaner houses; but even with
these better-sort of houses it is necessary to order meals
by the forebud, for a guest is so rare, that they have no
standing arrangements for his reception. My breakfast
had been ordered at the third station. It proved a
decent, plain house, with clean-boarded floors, and a few
rude prints along the walls; and, had there been wheaten
bread, the eggs and coffee would have enabled me to
make a tolerable meal.</p>

<p>The country passed over to-day consisted of low rocky
hills of soft outline, with alluvial plains between. It is
impossible for any person of common powers of observation
to fail to be struck with the appearance of the
rocky surface presented around Gottenburg and along the
road upon which I was now travelling. All the abruptnesses
and asperities usually seen upon rocks are here
ground off: all is smooth and rounded. Here you see
great ridges, resembling the hull of a ship turned keel
uppermost, both in the general form and the smoothness
of surface. There you see great slopes, as straight and
smooth as an ashlar wall. Sometimes a kind of trough
or channel is seen between rising ridges, and of this the
sides are usually quite smooth. In general, there has
been a certain weathering of the exterior, though leaving
the general plane&mdash;if I may use such an expression&mdash;in
its original state. Where the surface has been from
any cause protected from the elements, the smoothing
is clearly seen to be a true mechanical polish; that is
to say, not a result of some causes connected with the
formation of the rock, but an effect proceeding from
some external agent which has operated on the rocks
after they had been thrown into their present arrangement
as a surface for this part of the earth. On these
preserved surfaces we find striæ or scratches, evidently
a portion of the general operation, whatever it was;
and these striæ, as well as the channellings and ridges,
lie in one direction&mdash;namely, <i>compass</i> N. E. and S. W.
In numberless instances in travelling to-day I took out
my compass to test this point, where much struck by the
appearances, and the result was invariable. The valley
of the Gotha Elv lies from north to south; but this
seems merely to have exposed it to being impressed with
these singular appearances. There are several hill-faces
which may be considered as an exception, being
rough and cliffy, sometimes with a talus of débris
descending from below the cliffy front, as in Salisbury
Crags near Edinburgh. In all such instances the face
of the cliff is to the <i>south-west</i>; and where this occurs
in a valley, the opposite hill-face is invariably smooth,
with rounded surfaces, showing as if the smoothing
agent had moved from the north-east, failing to press
against faces turned away from that point of the compass,
but bearing hard upon such as were presented
towards it. It was most impressive and interesting to
read in these facts so strange a tale of grand preterite
operations of nature. I had seen some of the few and
scattered markings of the same kind which exist on
the surface of my own country, but was nevertheless
unprepared for the all but universal grinding to which
Sweden has been subjected. In Scotland one has to seek
for the appearances in nooks of the country; but here
they are met at every step. Very often farm establishments,
and the inns at which the traveller stops,
are placed on smoothed plateaux of rock, the place
thus acquiring from nature all the benefit of a paved
courtyard, as well as of a perfectly firm and dry foundation.
Often you can trace in these natural pavements
the primitive channellings and striæ, though hob-nails
and wagon-wheels have clattered over them for centuries.</p>

<p>The matter massed up against the smoothed valley-sides
has all the appearance of that of <i>moraines</i> amongst
the Alps. A moraine, as must be known by many
persons, is the accumulation of loose matter which a
glacier brings down in its course, and deposits at its
base. The matter seen here, as at the skirts of the
Alpine glaciers, is a coarse, pale, sandy clay, mixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
rough stones of all sizes up to many tons&mdash;mixed confusedly&mdash;with
here and there little nests of matter,
where the clay and sand have been separated and laid
down by water. Over this matter in some places are
stratified sand and gravel, coming to flat, terraced
forms, like sea-beaches. These, however, are rare objects.
The tendency of the whole appearances, in an
unprejudiced mind, is to convey the idea that ice has
been the cause of the main phenomena. That water in
any form could have produced them is utterly inadmissible,
though this was the supposition formed by the
first scientific observer, M. Sefstrom. Persons who
have only read descriptions of the appearances may
think them explainable upon an aqueous theory; but
if they visit Sweden, and look at the surface with their
own eyes, they must, if open to conviction at all, see
that no such agent could have produced such effects.
Only some agent applying forcibly, pressingly, and with
an equable, continuous motion&mdash;like a plane going over
a deal, or a plough in a furrow&mdash;could have so dressed
the original surface. Such an agent is <span class="lowercase smcap">ICE</span>. The identity
of the loose matter with the moraines of existing
glaciers points to the same conclusion. I therefore
believe, with M. Agassiz and others, that ice has been
the means of smoothing the surface of Sweden&mdash;ice on
a scale of grandeur beyond what we are accustomed to
see; though how such a glacial sheet was originated,
and how it could move across the whole irregular
face of a large country, up hill and down hill, maintaining
over wide provinces one direction, I think it
would be difficult to explain. We perceive clearly the
nature of the agent, and we see this agent still at work
upon the earth, though in a limited manner: the only
difficulty is as to the different physical circumstances on
which depended the magnitude of the phenomenon and
the manner of its application. The superficial arrangements
of the loose matter speak of a subsequent dip
under water, a fact of which I shall have occasion to
show other evidences.</p>

<p>The country passed over in this day's journey is not
interesting to any but the geologist. It presents only
a series of humble-looking farmsteads, and one or two
small and unimportant towns. The farmhouses bear
a general resemblance to those of Switzerland, but
want the overhanging eaves, and are less picturesque,
though some are painted of a red or ochrey colour,
which gives a cleanly effect. Unlike Switzerland,
too, barns, byres, and all sorts of store-offices occupy
detached buildings, an arrangement by which the risk
of fire is materially reduced. The scenery, though
sufficiently rude, is not romantic; for the hills are
in general only a few hundred feet above the level of
the sea, and their outline has been rendered tame by
the glacial polishing above described. The ice, as I
sometimes surprised my Scandinavian friends by remarking,
has been a great enemy to the picturesque
in this region of the earth. Though there is no want
of population, the country is dull. One misses even
the little taverns and huckstry-shops which everywhere
give a sort of life to the roadsides in England and
Scotland. In the afternoon we came to a fiord, and
found at its upper extremity the town of Uddevalla, containing
from 3000 to 4000 inhabitants. Uddevalla is a
name of no small interest in science, because of a great
bed of ancient shells found near it. This, too, is a kind
of object very rare, and only seen on a most limited
scale in the superficial formations of Britain. The
effect was novel and startling when, on the hill-face
overlooking the fiord, and at the height of two hundred
feet above its waters, I found something like a group
of gravel-pits, but containing, instead of gravel, nothing
but shells! It is a nook among the hills, with a surface
which has originally been flat in the line of the fiord,
though sloping forward towards it. We can see that
the whole space is filled to a great depth with the exuviæ
of marine mollusks, cockles, mussels, whelks, &amp;c.
all of them species existing at this time in the Baltic,
with only a thin covering of vegetable mould on the
surface. That surface has been broken in several places
by the peasantry, who dig and carry away these spoils
of ancient seas to spread them over their lands. I feel
sure that some of their excavations are twenty feet
deep; yet that is not the whole thickness of the shell-bed.
Of course it is a proof of the sea and land having
formerly been at a different relative level; and one more
convincing could not be desired. I was familiar with
this as a geological fact; but the shell-bed of Uddevalla
presented it with a freshness and liveliness of evidence
beyond what I would have expected. Seeing these
shells so entire, so like in all respects to any bed of
shells on the present shore, one looks upon the period
antecedent to the assumption of the present relative
level as a thing of yesterday; the whole series of intermediate
events, including, what is probably but a small
part of it, the course of the written history of the human
race, seems concentrated into that brief space which,
relatively to the entire history of the universe, it actually
occupies.</p>

<p>My halting-place for the first night was at Quistrom,
ten and a-half Swedish, or about seventy English miles
from Gottenburg. This reminds me to remark that
the mile in Sweden, in consequence of an arrangement
adopted during the last century, is fixed at the tenth
part of a geographical degree, which, it will be remembered,
is about 69½ English miles. For such spaces as
we require the term <i>mile</i> to designate, the Swedes speak
of quarter and half-quarter miles. The roads exhibit
formidable 'milestones' for each quarter, usually adorned
with the initials of the king under whose reign they
were erected. In the whole of this day's journey I had
passed only one gentleman's house&mdash;a pretty place with
a park, near Quistrom; and I was afterwards informed
that it belonged to an Englishman. Country-houses,
of a character approaching that of an English gentleman's
mansion, are objects scarcely existing in either
Sweden or Norway, except in the immediate neighbourhood
of the larger towns.</p>

<p>At Quistrom I was shown into a large room in an
upper floor, uncarpeted, but strewed thickly with small
pieces of pine spray and juniper bush, the scent of which
is abundantly pungent. This is a description applicable
to most public rooms in the country inns of Scandinavia,
the vegetable sprinkling being designed for exactly the
same effect as a sprinkling of yellow sand in British
houses of a humble class. In obedience to the forebud
order, a meal was ready to be laid down for me, consisting
of two small dishes of animal food, with milk, cheese,
and hard cakes of rye. Everything was clean, though
homely. A married pair with a child had arrived in a
light vehicle about the same time with me; and as soon
as I was done with eating, I retired to my bedroom,
that they might sup in privacy at the same table. They
had a bedroom at one side; I one at the other, a plain
small room, also uncarpeted, and possessing little furniture
besides a small couch of plain deals. I mention
these things as characteristic of the roadside inns all
over the country. Here, as everywhere else, there was
snowy bed-linen. I feared the entomology of the house,
but was agreeably disappointed. The stories told of
Sweden and Norway in this respect are surely exaggerations.
At least I can say, with a safe conscience,
that of the <i>cimicidæ</i> I never saw one example, and of the
species <i>pulex irritans</i> only two, during the whole time I
was in the country. It is a point not unworthy of
notice, for, under different impressions, I had for many
nights much less steady sleep than is desirable for a
traveller.</p>

<p>An early walk next morning showed me the situation
of the inn in a pleasant valley, where a river terminates
in a fiord. The river, I was told, contains abundance
of fine fish, and I bethought me that for an angler such
an opportunity of sport, with so cleanly an inn to live
in, might be very attractive. Quist having contrived
the night before to get several forebud notices sent on
by a private hand free of expense, I started at eight
o'clock, with some uncertainty as to the conclusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
my day's journey. The country passed over to-day
consisted of low rocky hills, all smoothed, with spaces
between, filled up to various heights with detrital
matter. This matter usually composes flats, and the
ground therefore joins the rocky hills almost as mountain
lakes join the sides of the basins containing them&mdash;a
feature speaking significantly of the operations of
the sea upon the stuff left at the conclusion of the
glacial action. Contrary to my expectation, very few
boulders appeared upon the hills. Sometimes a rill
cuts down the alluvial flat, and then we see a series of
cultivated fields on the bisected level spaces, frontiered
by steep pastoral banks, all in a flush of wild-flowers.
The rounded gray rocky hills; the alluvial flats, sometimes
cultivated, sometimes in moorland; low, gray,
stone enclosures; red wooden houses scattered at wide
intervals; now and then a whitened church, with a red
wooden spire, topping a low height&mdash;such were the predominant
features of the landscape during this morning's
drive. The people are remarkably civil and inoffensive:
not a man or boy do I pass or meet who does
not take off his hat. I feel this as courtesy, not as servility,
and am careful to return each greeting duly, in
order that so amiable a custom may not suffer by me.
There is one singular impediment in travelling: almost
every few hundred yards&mdash;though often at very much
wider intervals&mdash;a gate crosses the road, being part of
the system of farm enclosures, and having a regard to
the exclusion of cattle from the corn-fields. Generally
some cottage child or group of children is ready to run
and open the gate for the approaching vehicle; and for
this service a minute coin, such as the third or sixth
of a skilling, is regarded as a rich reward. Where
no such aid is at hand, the charge-taker of the horses
has to descend and throw up the bar. Another novel
feature of the roads is the frequent appearance by the
wayside of little posts bearing small boards, which contain
an inscription&mdash;as 'Hede, 200 alnar,' 'Hogdal, 134
alnar,' &amp;c. The explanation is, that the roads in Sweden
and Norway are kept up by the bonder or peasants,
each taking charge of some small section near his farm.
The boards show for what piece each is answerable, the
space being indicated in ells. A public officer makes
periodical rounds, to see that each person executes his
portion in a satisfactory manner, and to impose fines
where the duty is neglected. This system partakes of
the character of the compulsory furnishing of horses,
and imparts a curious idea of the state of public opinion
in these countries as to personal liberty. It appears
that, let there be never such liberal or democratic forms
established on the continent, the state of individual
liberty remains the same: the central government is
still permitted to bandy about the simple subject at
its pleasure. And the oddest consideration is, that,
amidst all the democratic struggles and revolutionary
writhings which occasionally take place, no one thinks
of complaining of these trammelments, or getting them
corrected.</p>

<p>In the evening I approached a fiord called Swinesund,
which forms the northern limit of Sweden in this
direction. At the last station on the Swedish side an
elderly officer-like man came up with great politeness,
and addressed me, first in Swedish, and afterwards in
German. It was his duty to search the baggage of
travellers before they should pass into Norway, though
I cannot imagine for what reason, unless the exaction
of a rigs dollar, or some such trifle, which I paid to
save myself from detention, furnish one. At a house
on the Norwegian margin of the fiord something more
was paid, my passport inspected, and my name entered
in a book. The tendency on the continent to petty
impositions of this kind is so great, that here, even between
two countries under one sovereign rule, they are
kept up. At this point a bag of Swedish money, with
which I had been furnished at Gottenburg, and with
which I was just beginning to become familiar, ceased
to be useful, and a new kind became necessary. Laying
down rigs-gelt dollars and skillings, I had to take up
with specie dollars and marks. A rigs-gelt dollar, I
may remark, is equivalent to 13½d. of English money,
and the skilling is its forty-eighth part. Calculations are,
however, made in an all but imaginary denomination
called dollars and skillings <i>banco</i>, which are as 3 to 2 of
the actual rigs-gelt. The prevalent monies are, in
reality, notes of 1, 3, 5 rigs-gelt dollars, and for 8, 12,
16 skillings banco, the smallest of this paper-money
being for 3½d. English. As may readily be imagined,
the threepence-halfpenny note is generally found in
no very neat or cleanly state; yet though it may be a
mere clot of dirty paper, not much different in appearance
from a huddled-up spider's web, it will be preferred
by the natives to coin, provided it only retain the
signature of the government banker. In Norway, they
have notes for 1 specie dollar (about 4s. 6d. English),
2, 5, and 10 dollars, with silver marks and half-marks
(9d. and 4¼.), and copper skillings. I need scarcely
remark that the plunge into a new money in the course
of continental travel is always a painful thing, and that
it is a vexation which occurs the more frequently the
more rapidly you travel. On this occasion I had had to
make acquaintance with three kinds of money in about
a week.</p>

<p>I spent the night at Westgaard, the first station
within Norway, and one somewhat superior to the last.
I here observed the first examples of a piece of substantial
furniture very common in the north&mdash;namely, large
chests or arks, usually bearing the name of a person, and
an old date in quaint lettering, such as 'Agnes Olsen,
1733.' During the two previous days the weather had
been dull and ungenial. The third morning proved
bright and clear, and I started at an early hour for
Frederickshald with elevated spirits. This place was a
few miles out of the way; but I was anxious to see the
scene of the death of that extraordinary prince who, as
Johnson says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;'left a name, at which the world grew pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To point a moral, and adorn a tale.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was yet scarcely past seven o'clock when we drove
into the inn-yard at this little town. The landlord soon
came, and being able to speak well in French, and a
little in English, he proved a most serviceable ally. I
was quickly on my way, under proper conduct, to the
scene of the assassination of poor Carl Tolv. Frederickshald
is a neat, cleanly town, at the head of one of
the smaller fiords, and the fort lies close by, perched
upon a rocky eminence of considerable extent, at the
foot of which runs a river, noted for several fine waterfalls.
A painful ascent of two or three hundred feet,
along zig-zagging causeways and fortified walls, brings
us to the fortress, which seems to be now chiefly a mere
post for soldiers, like Edinburgh and Stirling castles.
Behind the main buildings is a space of irregular rocky
ground, enclosed within the exterior defences. Here an
enclosure of trees and shrubs, and a little tumulus of
stones, one of them bearing a half-obliterated inscription,
marks the spot where Charles XII. was slain. He
had invaded Norway in his usual madcap style; one of
his armies, consisting of 7000 men, had there been literally
buried in a snow-storm; he was now directing in
person the siege of this fortress, when an unknown hand
despatched him by a shot which penetrated his temple
(December 11, 1718). He was found dead, but with
his sword half-drawn, as if to defend himself from some
enemy, or to punish an assassin, and it is accordingly
believed that the wound was inflicted by one of his own
people. A survey of the ground supports this view of
the matter, as at such a place one does not readily see
how the fatal shot could have come from the fortress.
I had afterwards an opportunity of examining the dress
worn at this time by the king, in the Riddarsholm
Church at Stockholm. The plain cocked-hat shows the
hole by which the bullet entered, and the right glove
is stained with blood, as if the unfortunate monarch,
under the first impulse of the moment, had clapped his
hand upon the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast, I took a walk around the town, and
very much enjoyed the views almost everywhere presented,
but particularly one from a noted place within
a gentleman's pleasure-grounds. Frederickshald appears
to me a more pleasing and interesting place than
the guide-books allow. In the little park alluded to I
found a private cemetery, containing the graves of eight
adults and three infants. Each grave is a well-defined
heap, with turf sides and ends, but a top of bare earth,
on which is laid a single wreath; all the rest of the
ground bare earth. Such is a prevalent style of sepulture
in the north; it has a neat and pretty effect. One
likes to see a grave well-defined. That smoothing of
the ground, introduced in some of the improved modern
cemeteries of England, is not, I think, an approvable
step. We desire the 'mouldering heap,' so affectingly
significant of what is below, and so associated with all
our old literary ideas upon the subject.</p>

<p>After receiving a lesson in Norwegian money from
my intelligent landlord, Mr Stein, and so many civilities
of various kinds, that I felt ashamed of the small bill
which I had to pay, I set out on the way to Christiania,
returning for some miles along the way by which I had
come from Westgaard. As we drove out of the town,
I was, as a stranger, honoured with a sufficient quantity
of observation by the people. To add to the fracas produced
by the carriage, a foal came clattering along by our
side, apparently under a filial mistake as to one of our
horses. Presently a cart was heard making a furious
rattle along the stones behind us, as if still further to
make my poor equipage an object of public attention.
It was the mamma of the foal, who, having missed her
progeny in the market-place, was now anxious to
recover the lost one: there she came, with mouth distended,
and eyes glaring, the whole aspect expressing
the utmost excitement, and saying as plainly as words
could have spoken it, 'What's all this?&mdash;taking away
my child!' The whole was so vividly like human
affairs, that I felt inclined to stop and apologise for our
unintentional concern in the elopement; but Quist
settled the matter more summarily by a smart application
of his whip to the haunches of our undesired
attaché. It may be remarked that in Norway the foal
is often allowed to accompany its parent, even in coach-travelling.
I have seen it come the whole stage, never
missing any opportunity afforded by a pause of our
machine to come up and indulge in the mode of nutrition
appropriate to its age. Horses are altogether less
under strict rule in the north than with us, and it
appears to me as if they consequently were more <i>natural</i>
in their conduct. For one thing, they are eminently
social with one another. In the course of a long stage
over a thinly-peopled country, if we come at length to
a park where a horse is feeding, even I could almost say
though out of sight, our own pachyderms are sure to
get up a great skirl of recognition, just as much as to
say, 'How are you?&mdash;how are you?' My predecessor,
Mr Laing, alleges that they have a rational way of
eating not observed in the horses of less democratic
countries&mdash;taking first a quantity of their hay or corn,
and then a drink; but I cannot say I ever could observe
them acting in this bite-and-sup manner. Of
their amazing steadiness, sureness of foot, and hardiness,
abundant evidence is presented to every traveller.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day we arrived at the brink of
the river Glommen, a copious stream, which contains
the drainage of a large district in the centre of Norway,
and which is here remarkable for a cascade of great
grandeur. The fall is at a place about an English mile
above the ferry: the flood pours in one mass through
a narrow channel, and makes a descent of about seventy
feet. It would be an unexceptionably fine sight but for
the details of an enormous timber-sawing and exporting
establishment which press in upon its beauties,
and usurp not a few of its most romantic points. The
river runs fourteen English miles below the waterfall,
but so gently, that ships come up for the timber; and
the river is there accordingly an active commercial
scene. I observed at the falls specimens of the smoothed
and dressed rocks, over which the water streamed in
an oblique direction&mdash;a fact than which nothing could
be more convincing as to the incompetency of water to
produce the effects attributed to the ice. The country
is here low, and not marked by any features of grandeur.
There is an alluvial plain of the most absolute flatness
for fully a mile in every direction around the ferry;
and from the measurements which I made (starting
from the surface of the river at that point), I suspect
this to be identical in elevation above the sea with the
terrace at Elsinore. This is, however, a point which
must be left for determination to the native inquirers.</p>

<p>We stopped for the night at Moss, a town on the
Christiania Fiord, where my servant and I had each an
evening and morning meal, with lodging, at a charge of
about six shillings. Yet this was a good large house,
very tolerably furnished. A small silver coin (value
about 5d.) laid in the hardened palm of the blithesome
lass who served as an attendant in all capacities made
her the happiest of the happy. As a serving-girl in
Denmark, Sweden, or Norway, only gets about 30s. a
year of wages, it may readily be imagined that even
so small a gratuity as this is a great prize to her. It
is necessary, however, to be careful to give such a
gratuity directly to the person for whom it is designed,
as it will not otherwise reach its destination. At this
place there are alluvial terraces at various elevations
above the sea, and precisely resembling the ancient sea-margins
of the British coasts. A circumstance worthy
of note occurred in the business of measuring their
elevations, which I did with a regular levelling apparatus.
The sea is here presented in two detached bays,
embracing a peninsula of several miles in extent, yet
approaching within two hundred yards of each other,
with only the division of a low isthmus. One of these
bays appeared by my survey as 0.9 foot above the level
of the other. The cause was in the wind, which blew
up the one bay, and down the other.</p>

<p>There remained only a forenoon's journey to Christiania.
As we approached this capital, there was no
observable improvement in the appearance of the country;
no better houses, no trimmer or larger fields, no
smarter-looking people; the same rough and homely
character over all things. The roads are made of the
sand and gravel found everywhere near their borders;
no cuttings anywhere for improved gradients. A rise
of 1 in 5 is not uncommon when any of the rocky
ridges between the plains has to be crossed. Two miles
from Christiania we come to the brow of a hill, whence
we see the bright white city with its blue and red-tiled
roofs lying below at the head of its fiord, backed by
green slopes ascending to the pine-clad hills. The
descent of this hill is terrible, from the extreme steepness
of the road, especially at its somewhat sharp turnings.
Having a geologist's climometer in my pocket, I
measured the slope in some places with all possible
care, and found it actually on an angle of 16 degrees,
implying a rise of 1 in 3½ feet. I deemed this a strange
sight so near one of the capitals of Europe; but I must
do the Norwegians the justice to say that a better road
is in the course of being made.</p>

<p>On the two last days' journeys we met many parties
of Norwegian infantry on their march or exercising.
They are a good-looking soldiery, neatly dressed in
white duck-trousers and green frock-coats, with burnished-leather
hats rising to a metal peak, each bearing
the arms of Norway&mdash;a ramping lion holding a battle-axe.
As to this ensign, by the way, though gratifying
to the national vanity, and poetically conveying the
idea which its originators intended, it belongs to a class
which cannot be scientifically contemplated without a
shock. The philosophical zoologist reflects on the
adaptations of the natural organs, and knowing the
very peculiar formation of the anterior extremities of
the feline family&mdash;so well contrived for clutching and
tearing a prey, so useless for every other kind of prehension&mdash;he
cannot endure the idea of one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
animals being supposed to hold a weapon only adapted
to the hand of man. Heralds, if they could think of
anything beside their own profession, should study these
things!</p>

<h2><a name="PLAN_FOR_MAINTAINING_THE_INDEPENDENCE" id="PLAN_FOR_MAINTAINING_THE_INDEPENDENCE">PLAN FOR MAINTAINING THE INDEPENDENCE
OF THE LABOURING-CLASS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has often occurred to us, and we have once or twice
hinted at the idea in the Journal, that the working-classes
might make a provision for themselves in times
of want, whether occasioned by failure of employment
or natural disability through disease or old age, if they
could be induced to agree to a system of stoppages like
that which has existed for ages in the mercantile navy
for the support of Greenwich Hospital. We find that,
in 1843, probably before the date of any reference of
ours to the subject, though unknown to us, Mr David
Milne, a patriotic country gentleman of Scotland, and
member of the Scottish bar, made a suggestion to this
effect to the commissioners who conducted the Poor-Law
inquiry in Scotland. His idea was this:&mdash;Let some
small sum, say sixpence a month, be deducted from the
amount of wages under a law to that effect, and thrown
into a fund upon which every contributor would have
a claim. He conceived that, in five years, so much
would be accumulated, that the managers might begin
to give support to any number under a twentieth part
of the original contributors. Some one had suggested
to Mr Milne that it might be well if the law taxed the
masters to an equal extent for the benefit of the fund;
but he rejected this idea, on the ground of its injustice,
and because it would induce employers to be less
anxious to carry on their works in unfavourable times
for the sake of giving bread to their people. 'It is also
to be considered,' says Mr Milne, 'that the duty of
sixpence a month for each workman would, in ordinary
times, when trade is prosperous, and labourers in demand,
actually fall upon the employers, because the
natural competition of trade would make up for the
deduction of duty by a corresponding rise of wages.'
Mr Milne was, however, not unwilling that appeals to,
and even a general assessment upon, the rich should be
resorted to when the fund failed under the pressure of
any unusual calamity.</p>

<p>There cannot, we think, be a doubt that if this plan
were practicable, it would be a great improvement in
our social economy. At present, the bulk of the working-people
of this country have scarcely anything to
save them from a state of dependence whenever they
fail in getting work, or are no longer fit for it. In Scotland,
the able-bodied man who cannot obtain work and
wages, has no legal recourse to the poors' funds. In
England he has, but accompanied by conditions calculated
to lower the man in his own eyes; and therefore
the privilege is no true advantage. Even though the
poors' funds were more available than they are, the
honest workman who wishes to maintain his self-respect
can never complacently place his trust in them; for
though it is not uncommon to hear individuals in
humble life proclaiming that they have a <i>right</i> to them,
the fact really is, that these funds are only a product of
the humanity and economy of the country, designed
to insure that there shall be no class left to misery
and the barbarism attending it, but not to interpose
between any one and his obligation to gain his own
subsistence if possible. In plain truth, he who accepts
parochial relief sells away some of his very best rights
as a citizen, as well as his dignity as a man; and any
one who wishes to exalt either the social or political
position of the labouring-class, should desire nothing so
much as to see them in the first place superior to all
but a remote chance of coming to this wretched expedient.
If any feasible and easy-working plan could be
devised for enabling them, mainly by sacrifices on their
own part, to defy the prospect of becoming paupers, or
leaving their children to pauperism, they would certainly
have received the greatest boon that any philanthropist
could confer upon them.</p>

<p>We fear that no such plan is at present practicable.
There is too much prejudice among the labouring-class
against their employers to admit of its being received
with general favour. While an honourable minority
would be glad to see their independence secured, the
great mass would undoubtedly prefer going on upon
their present footing, careless how soon the failure of
business or the occurrence of sickness should deprive
them of an independent subsistence. Some such plan,
however, may be expected to be realised when the
labouring-class shall have acquired a just feeling for
their own character, and a just sense of their relation
to the rest of society. It would only be a fair and proper
part of a social system in which the highest behests
of a true civilisation were worked out. How soon it
may come about will depend on the rapidity with which
the education of the masses of the people shall proceed.
If, from any narrow views of whatever kind, a member
of the middle or upper classes in this country finds himself
thwarting the movements towards universal and
improved education, let him understand what he pays
for the gratification he thus obtains. He pays for it in
large poor-rates and prison-rates, and in the distress
which his humanity must be continually receiving from
the spectacle of a multitude of his fellow-creatures lost
to the sense of self-respect, and consequently subjected
to a vast load of misery.</p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_LATE_DR_ZUMPT" id="THE_LATE_DR_ZUMPT">THE LATE DR ZUMPT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> an early stage of our labours, many years ago,
we took occasion to offer, for the consideration of the
young, a memoir of Professor Heyne of Gottingen, one
of the greatest scholars of the age, and who, by dint of
perseverance, rose from a very humble to an exalted
station in life. Heyne presented not an uncommon
instance of German enthusiasm in scholarship. In our
own country, erudition seems to be pursued chiefly for
the sake of professional advancement, and consequently
it seldom attains to any very lofty pitch. How few of
our scholars, it may be asked, know anything critically
of the ancient classics? How few write or speak Latin
with elegance or purity? How few ever saw any more
recondite exemplars of Roman literature than elementary
school-books&mdash;the copy of a copy? In Germany,
where no sort of painstaking seems to be grudged,
scholarship has gone, and still goes on, immeasurably
farther. As in the case of Heyne, Wolf, Hermann,
Boeckh, Vater, Gesenius, and others, men are there
found devoting themselves to a whole lifetime of earnest
study in complete forgetfulness of self. Living
perhaps on the merest trifle, they bury themselves in a
library surrounded by old vellum-bound classics; and
there, poring over dingy yellow pages, they compare
words with words, examine into the merits of punctuation
and orthography, and detect new meanings, till
they transfuse into themselves, as it were, the very soul
of their author. In this way, by collating old and
priceless versions of the classics&mdash;some of them in manuscript,
and unique&mdash;they are able to produce modern editions,
which are greedily accepted throughout European
universities, and which have usually formed the basis
of elementary works for British compilers. We at least
know of few works in Latin common in our schools
which have not been copied in a reduced form from
the painfully-constructed editions of German scholars.
We have been led into these observations from a desire
to do honour to the memory of one whose name has
gone to swell the already long list of German philologists.</p>

<p>Carl Gottlob Zumpt, the individual to whom we refer,
was born at Berlin in 1792. His parents were not
wealthy: but in the circumstances in which Prussia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
was placed at the beginning of the present century, this
was a matter of little importance. The oppressions of
France pretty nearly brought down all ranks into one
common mass of distress and poverty. To meet the cruel
exactions of Napoleon, families gave up every article of
value to the state. For their gold they received tokens
in iron; and these acknowledgments are still treasured
by families, as lasting memorials of an adversity which
took away almost everything but life. Amidst these
national sufferings and humiliations, Carl Gottlob Zumpt
received such an education as could then be procured.
Fortunately he required no incitement to learn: from
childhood he had been a diligent porer over books;
and the acquisition of languages cost him no trouble.
Nature made him a scholar. After passing through a
series of schools and gymnasia in Berlin, he was sent,
by the advice of Buttman, the well-known grammarian,
to the university of Heidelberg, which at that time
enjoyed a high reputation. Kreuzer, Voss, Boeckh,
belonged to it, all of them men of talent, and celebrated
for their philological learning. During Zumpt's residence
at Heidelberg, the university of Berlin was founded;
and returning home, he finished his education in his
native city.</p>

<p>Though still a young man, Zumpt was already noted
for his remarkable attainments in the Greek and
Roman languages. Thrown upon his own resources, he
soon distinguished himself, and was appointed a teacher
in one of the principal seminaries. From this position
he subsequently rose to be Professor of History in the
Royal Military Academy, and finally to be Professor
of Roman Literature in the university of Berlin.</p>

<p>The life of a scholar is usually barren of incident.
There is little to tell about Zumpt. Amidst the
cares of public teaching, he found time to occupy himself
in writing various works, critical and historical, all
connected with his favourite branch of study. To
improve his knowledge of antiquities, he made a tour
through Italy and Greece, which, while of considerable
service to him as a man of letters, unfortunately tended
to injure his health. This tour was made in 1835, and
after that year Zumpt laboured still more assiduously
at his critical editions of the classics, unmindful of
aught but that love of digging among ancient words
and thoughts which seems a fanaticism in the German
mind. His great aim was to be a Latinist worthy of
the Augustine age itself. Nor was he unsuccessful;
for he wrote Latin with great elegance. He was seldom
required to speak the language; but when called
on to do so, he delivered himself with correctness and
fluency. In this respect he is supposed to have had no
superior among his learned countrymen.</p>

<p>Holding this man in respect, not alone for his intellectual,
but his moral and social qualities, we shall
always consider it as something to say that we have
enjoyed his personal acquaintance. In the course of a
tour in Germany, and short residence in Berlin in 1847,
we had the pleasure of visiting him at his house in the
Burgher Strasse&mdash;a terrace-like street on a branch of the
Spree. We found Zumpt entombed amidst his books.
Tall in person, emaciated from study, and wrapped in a
dressing-gown, he rose and affectionately welcomed us
to Berlin in tolerable English&mdash;a language which, in
compliment, he insisted all his family should speak on
every occasion of our visit. At this time he was engaged
on his edition of 'Quintus Curtius'&mdash;a work
which will long be regarded as a monument of his
industry and learning.</p>

<p>One of the objects of our visit to Zumpt was to consult
with him on the subject of an enterprise in which
he had recently engaged&mdash;the joint editorship, with Dr
Schmitz of Edinburgh, of a series of Latin classics for
use in schools. The projectors of this undertaking were
the publishers of the present sheet. Having in our own
early days experienced the dreary heaviness of ordinary
school classics, unrelieved by the slightest explanations
in English touching the subject or the authors, we were
glad to be instrumental in putting into the hands of youth
a series which they could peruse with some degree of
pleasure, or at all events not with absolute weariness and
disgust. As Dr Zumpt entered heartily into the design,
the arrangement promised to have the advantage of
naturalising in Britain a set of editions drawn freshly
from comparatively original sources, in place of the
bald reprints of antiquated copies. The task occupied
the amiable scholar during the remainder of his too short
life, at the close of which he had prepared the whole
series excepting a portion of Horace, which has consequently
fallen into the hands of his nephew and son-in-law,
A. W. Zumpt. A victim to his study of ancient
literature, his failing eyesight first, and afterwards disordered
viscera, admonished him to take some species
of relaxation. This counsel he took when too late. In
the hope of relief from his sufferings, he repaired to
Carlsbad, a watering-place in Bohemia; and there, to
the great grief of his family and friends, he died on the
25th of June last, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.
The decease of the illustrious Zumpt, together with
the loss of Orelli, and the veteran Hellenist, Gottfried
Hermann, both of whom died within the last eighteen
months, leaves a blank among European scholars which
will not soon be filled up.</p>

<h2><a name="COLA_MONTI" id="COLA_MONTI">COLA MONTI.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conceptions of female beauty which men form for
themselves are frequently, if not always, overturned by
some plain face, in which they find the mystic influence
they had supposed to belong only to features of
a particular and more perfect mould. In like manner
our theories touching certain departments of literature
are liable to be damaged now and then by the appearance
of a work which fulfils not one of the conditions
we had laid down as absolute necessities. Now
here, for instance, is a volume of fiction without even
an attempt at a plot, and yet with a perfect enchainment
of interest&mdash;a hero without adventures and without
a heroine, yet whose fortunes we follow with a true
excitement! How does this come about? Why do we
love plain women, and admire ill-constructed books?
Because there is an innate power in the irregular features
to excite our sympathies, and a quality in authors,
called Genius, to command them. No man, we will
venture to say, possessing common sensibility, can read
'Cola Monti,'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> although it is of the class of books for
young people, without a thoughtful brow and a glistening
eye; and we have heard a family circle declare
that 'they had found it impossible to lay down the
volume till they had finished it.'</p>

<p>Cola Monti is an Italian boy educated economically at
a boarding-school in England. His talent for drawing
exhibited itself first in caricatures of his companions,
and he then ventured to try his hand upon the master
himself. 'This was irresistible; and when the Doctor
stood out in relief from the slate in all his peculiarities&mdash;his
stiff collar, his upright hair, and his spectacles&mdash;the
likeness was such, that the boys gave a general hurra.
So much noise did they make, and so intent were they,
that no one heard the door open, until the original of
the portrait looked over Cola's shoulder and beheld&mdash;himself!
It was a terrible moment in schoolboy annals.
The Doctor looked, frowned, glanced round at the young
rebels, then again at the slate. Whether it was that
natural vanity made him feel rather pleased to see the
only likeness of himself which had ever been taken, or
whether Cola's sketch had less of caricature than nature,
it is impossible to say; but Doctor Birch smiled&mdash;absolutely
smiled! He was a good-tempered man, and
the boys knew it: they took advantage of it sometimes,
the naughty fellows! So the smile gradually went
round, until it became a laugh, and the schoolmaster
could not help laughing too.' The boy-artist then, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
the instigation of his companions, resolved to try his
chivalrous friend and patron Archibald M'Kaye:&mdash;'Archibald
looked surprised, and rather vexed; for one
of his weaknesses was, that he could not bear being
laughed at; however, he took his station. Cola finished
the sketch, but it was no caricature: it was a capital
likeness of Archibald's thoughtful head, with the soft
curling hair, and the calm, serious eyes. "Why, Cola,
you ought to be an artist," cried the boys when they
saw it. Cola smiled, and his eyes kindled. "I will
try!" he said in his own heart, and from that day he
drew no more caricatures.'</p>

<p>Cola Monti's national and personal sympathies were
now strongly excited in favour of a poor little Italian
organ-boy, who was found dying of starvation by the
roadside. He had no other means of permanently
assisting him than by supplying him with drawings to
sell, in the hope of thus enabling him to collect a fund
sufficient for the purchase of a new organ, his own
having been destroyed. This fund at length amounted,
by slow accumulations, to L.10 in silver; but the organ-boy,
who had become devotedly attached to his patron,
could not consent to be thus paid off. Poor Cola was
now in destitution himself. His mother had died; his
stepfather refused to contribute longer to his support;
and in fact he was thrown adrift upon the world. The
generous debate between him and his protégé was terminated
by both proceeding to London upon the fortune
of L.10&mdash;Cola to pursue his career of an artist, and
Seppi in the quality of his servant.</p>

<p>Arrived in London, 'Cola woke the next morning,
dreaming that he was at school again, and that, somehow
or other, his class was all composed of great stout
farmers, who would persist in repeating their Italian
verbs with a strong Staffordshire accent. The dream
vanished under the influence of a bright sunbeam that
crept through the small uncurtained window, and just
reached his nose. In London, the good-natured sun is
more partial to attic windows than to any other, and it
made Cola's tiny room quite cheerful. From thence he
looked, not at the street, which lay many feet below,
but skywards, where, above the tops of the houses, he
could see the great dome of St Paul's lifting itself up,
grand and giant-like, with its ball and cross glistening
in the clear light of early morning. This was the first
sight that struck Cola in London. His artist-mind felt
it to the uttermost. The numberless streets below
seemed so solemn and quiet, lying in the shadow of the
scarcely-risen sun; and though even now the sounds of
life were beginning to stir, they were but faint as yet,
while over the dark and half-awakened city watched
its great temple, already illumined with the sunbeams.
It was a scene that Cola never forgot, and never will
while he lives.' He finds his way as soon as possible to
the National Gallery. 'I shall not enlarge upon the
feelings of the boy-artist when he beheld for the first
time this grand collection of paintings. He had seen
many in his childhood; but the memory of them was
grown dim. He looked on these with the sensations of
one blind, who re-enters a long-forgotten world with his
eyes opened. He began to understand and to feel what
Art really was. This new sense dazzled and overwhelmed
him; his heart beat wildly; he trembled; and
fairly subdued with emotion, he sat down in the darkest
corner he could find, turned his face away into the
shadow, while the tears rose, large and silently, to the
long lashes, and dropped on the arm which he raised to
hide them.'</p>

<p>Cola worked, played, and starved by turns, like other
friendless adventurers in London; and then came the
grand event of his life&mdash;his first Academy picture&mdash;which
was very near being too late. 'Night and day
Cola worked, allowing himself only an hour or two for
sleep, and scarcely taking any food. His wild and desperate
energy sustained him to a degree almost miraculous.
Under the influence of this terrible excitement
his powers seemed redoubled: he painted as he had
never painted before. Archibald, evening after evening,
walked up from Islington, not to talk or reason&mdash;he
dared not do that in Cola's present state&mdash;but to sit
quietly in the painting-room, watching his labours, and
at times encouraging them with a few subdued words
of praise, which Cola sometimes scarcely heard. Even
M'Kaye was astounded by the almost miraculous way
in which, day after day, the picture advanced to completion
beneath the young artist's hand; and as he
looked, he could not but acknowledge that there is nothing
in this world so strong, so daring, so all-powerful
as genius.</p>

<p>'The first Monday in April came&mdash;there were but
four-and-twenty hours left; Tuesday&mdash;there were but
twelve! Seppi stood by with the untasted dinner, his
bright black eyes continually filling with tears. He
dared not even speak to his young master, who, with
wild and haggard looks, was painting still.</p>

<p>'The clock struck six as Cola's now trembling hand
put the last stroke to his picture, and sank on a chair.</p>

<p>"It will do now, I think; it will not disgrace me at
least."</p>

<p>"No, indeed it will not, dear Cola! It is a beautiful
picture," whispered the gentle, encouraging voice of
Archy, who had come direct from Bread Street hither.
"And now, do have some dinner, or, what will be better
for you, some tea."</p>

<p>"No, no; I can't eat: we shall lose the time: the
Academy will be shut. Seppi, I must have a cab, and
go there at once."</p>

<p>'Archibald saw resistance would have been vain and
cruel, so he quietly suffered his friend to step into the
cab, and followed him. All the long ride to Trafalgar
Square Cola did not utter a single word, but sat motionless,
with his picture in his arms. M'Kaye offered to
hold it; but the other rejected his aid with a slight
motion of the head. At last Cola relinquished this
darling first-fruits of his genius with a look something
like that of a mother parting from a beloved child, and
then sank fainting into his friend's arms. That night
Cola Monti was in a brain fever.' The picture was
successful, and the boy-caricaturist grew at the same
time to be an artist and a man.</p>

<p>Although Cola Monti, artistically speaking, is an imperfect
story, it possesses both power and promise of
no ordinary kind. The power is evident in the book
itself: the promise rests upon the fact, that the author
is a young lady now struggling, by her own unaided
genius, through the stony and thorny paths of the
literary profession. But we would not have her rely
upon genius alone, or consider 'Cola Monti' as anything
more than a promise or a pledge. It is like a
gleam of light disclosing partially, and for a moment,
a scene which in some measure owes its beauty and
value to the mind of the beholder. It is suggestive
of high thoughts, fine aspirations, sad memories. It
throws the intellectual man back into his experiences,
and impels the daring and generous youth forward in
the path of his hopes and resolves. But in all this it
relies upon those it addresses, pointing mysteriously
before and behind, and accomplishing nothing of itself.
But this is obviously owing to want of effort, not want
of power. The author must follow the example of her
hero, and give her days and her nights to the labour
of her calling. She must look upon her heretofore
attempts as so many separate studies, and construct
with toil and determination a work of art not only
harmonious in colouring, not only accurate in drawing,
but skilful in Design.</p></div>

<h2><a name="LADY_SETTLERS_IN_AUSTRALIA" id="LADY_SETTLERS_IN_AUSTRALIA">LADY SETTLERS IN AUSTRALIA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr Lang</span>, in his description of the Port-Philip district,
alludes to the success which may there attend female
settlers who carry on the business of sheep-farming on
their own account; and mentions the following facts on
the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>'On the morning after our arrival at Geelong, Dr Thomson
accompanied me on a visit to Miss Drysdale, an elderly
maiden lady from Scotland, whose acquaintance and friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
I had had the honour of making on my first visit to
Geelong in the year 1843, when I had the pleasure of
spending a day or two under her hospitable roof. Miss
Drysdale is a lady of a highly-respectable family, and of
superior intelligence, her brother having been the late Sir
William Drysdale, treasurer of the city of Edinburgh.
Having a considerable patrimony of her own, and being of
an active disposition, and fond of rural pursuits, she had
rented a large farm in Scotland, of which she superintended
the management in person; but being a martyr, as she told
me, to the coughs and colds, and other ills that flesh is
heir to in our hyperborean Scottish climate, she resolved
to emigrate to a milder region, where she might hope to
enjoy better health, while she continued to indulge in her
favourite pursuits, and endeavour to exert a salutary influence
on some at least of her fellow-creatures, wherever
Divine Providence might fix her lot. And, I am happy to
add, Miss Drysdale sees no reason to regret the step she
took, in pursuance of this resolution, in emigrating to
Philipsland. She has uniformly enjoyed excellent health;
she is in the midst of such scenes, and scenery, and occupations
as she delighted in at home; the property she
invested in stock on her arrival in the colony must have
increased greatly during the interval that has since elapsed;
and she has not only exhibited the goodly and influential
example of a highly-respectable family living in the fear
of God, and in the zealous observance of all the ordinances
of religion, in a country in which, I am sorry to say, such
examples are rare, but she has had it in her power to
render the most valuable services to some who really required
what she has proved to them&mdash;a friend indeed. At
the period of my first visit to Geelong Miss Drysdale had
two of the younger daughters of the late Mr Batman residing
with her, to whom she was benevolently discharging
the duty of a parent; and her character as a doer of good
was generally known, and gratefully acknowledged, in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>'On her arrival in the colony, Miss Drysdale determined
to "squat," as it is styled in the phraseology of the country;
that is, to settle on a tract of unoccupied crown land, of
sufficient extent for the pasturage of considerable flocks
and herds, with their increase for several years&mdash;a tract, in
all likelihood, from twenty-five to fifty square miles in extent.
For this land the occupant pays a yearly license-fee
to the government of L.10, which insures to him for the
time being the full possession of the entire tract; and it
is universally understood that while this fee is paid, and
no offence committed against the laws and the customs of
squatting, the occupant shall not be disturbed, unless the
land is sold in the meantime to a <i>bona-fide</i> purchaser, at
not less than L.1 an acre, or required for government purposes&mdash;neither
of which events is, in ordinary circumstances,
at all likely to happen. It has not been allowed,
for a good many years past, to give a squatting license of
this kind to any person within a considerable distance of
a township or village; but Miss Drysdale was allowed, as
a special exception from this general rule, to occupy a
station within four miles of the town of Geelong. On that
station she accordingly erected a neat thatched cottage,
with glazed rustic lattice-windows, which she had carried
out with her from home, formed a garden, and fenced in
a sufficient extent of superior land for cultivation. The
cottage had been greatly improved, both externally and
internally, at the period of my visit in 1846, and three
years had made a wonderful change for the better upon
the garden, which had gravelled walks dividing the different
parterres&mdash;the only instance of the kind I had seen in the
country, and strongly reminding me of home.</p>

<p>'The situation of Miss Drysdale's cottage, to which she
has judiciously given the native name of the locality, Barrangoop,
which signifies a turf, is on a gentle grassy slope
towards the Barwon River, with the garden in front. The
cottages of her farm-overseer and servants are close at
hand, and remind one of a respectable farming establishment
in <i>the old country</i>. On my first visit to Geelong, I
found a respectable young man, who had been three sessions
at the university of Glasgow, as an intending candidate
for the Christian ministry, but who had subsequently
abandoned his studies, and gone out as a bounty emigrant
to Port Philip, acting in the humble capacity of tutor to
the children of Miss Drysdale's overseer, a respectable
Scotch farmer, with a large family. Upon the whole, there
was something of a domestic character about Miss Drysdale's
establishment generally which is but rarely seen at
the squatting stations of the interior; and I could not help
thinking that the very horses and cattle seemed to consider
themselves more at home than elsewhere.</p>

<p>'After passing Geelong to the left, the Barwon River,
which in this part of its course is a beautiful stream, pursues
a south-easterly course, nearly parallel to that of the
western arm of Port Philip, to the great Southern Ocean.
About nine or ten miles below Barrangoop it spreads out
into a series of lakes, as picturesque as any sheets of water
of that kind I have ever beheld. On my first visit to this
part of the country in 1843, I rode down to these lakes
along with Miss Newcome, another maiden lady, whom
Miss Drysdale had some time before taken into partnership
with herself&mdash;partly, I presume, that she might have some
kindred spirit&mdash;which, I am happy to say, Miss Newcome
unquestionably is&mdash;to whom she might be able to whisper
that "solitude was sweet." Miss Newcome was quite at
home on her high-spirited steed, and we gallopped along
through scenery of the richest description, beautiful grassy
plats alternating with clumps of trees of the most graceful
and ornamental foliage, till we reached the lakes. These
extensive sheets of glassy water, variegated with headlands
and islands, were absolutely alive with black swans, and
other waterfowl, sailing quietly along on their silent surface.
There must have been at least five hundred swans
in view at one time on one of the lakes. They were no
"raræ aves" there. Their deep solitudes, however, are
effectually invaded now; for the white man will soon thin
their ranks in all probability, and force them to retreat
before the progress of civilisation.'</p></div>

<h2><a name="SCOTTISH_BANKING" id="SCOTTISH_BANKING">SCOTTISH BANKING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is now reason to think that in pursuit of this object
our Scottish neighbours have got considerably ahead of us
here in England. The subject, indeed, seems congenial to
the shrewd faculties of our northern fellow-countrymen.
The founder of the Bank of England was a Scotchman: a
native of the same country originated the idea of the
Savings' Bank: and for a long period of time the facilities
and accommodations of banking have been known and
practised beyond the Tweed to an extent very much above
what has been attained in this country. Here banks may
be said to exist solely or chiefly for the wealthier classes
of society; in Scotland the advantages which they afford
are widely diffused among the middle ranks, and are shared
in a large measure by the petty capitalists and retail traders
of the towns and villages. As a proof of the great extension
of the system, we find that throughout Scotland there
is a bank for every 7500 of the population&mdash;in some districts
for every 5000. In London, the proportion is stated
to be only 1 for every 32,894; in some parts of England
1 for every 16,000. The rapid progress in wealth and
civilisation which has been made by a country naturally
so poor and sterile, has been attributed by many sagacious
observers to the multiplication of its banks, and to the
facilities afforded by them. Capital has been made to
stimulate industry in a double ratio, by the increased activity
and quickened speed with which it circulates through
the channels of commerce. Above all, this great desideratum
has been attained without any sacrifice of the other
prime requisite of sound banking&mdash;stability. Within the
last century and a-half it is computed that the loss to the
community in Scotland by the failure of the four or five
public banks which have stopped payment has not exceeded
L.26,000. In England, during a much shorter period, the
loss occasioned by those fearful catastrophes, both in London
and in the country, with which experience has made
us familiar, has certainly exceeded as many millions. It is
also a fact of much significance, that in 1793, in 1825, and
in the late crisis of 1847, the Scottish banks rode out the
storm which proved fatal to so many English establishments.
It seems, therefore, no undue claim which is set
up on the part of our northern neighbours, to a better
knowledge and more mature development of the principles
of banking than have been attained in this country.&mdash;<i>Morning
Chronicle.</i>&mdash;[There is no more than justice done, as
we believe, to Scotch banking in this paragraph. During
the last twenty years and upwards, there have been many
banks set up in England <i>on the Scotch principle</i>, as it is called;
but there have been many noted failures among them.
The fact is, that in England they introduce every feature
of Scottish banking <i>except the Scotch brains by which banking
has been so successfully conducted</i>. It is true Scotchmen have
been got to act as managers, secretaries, and cashiers; but
what were all these in the hands of a set of English directors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
who necessarily hold the chief sway? In an English
joint-stock bank, the bulk of the funds of the company
will be found ventured out in the hands of a few grand
speculators, on whose good or bad fortune the fate of the
establishment depends. No such thing was ever done in
a Scotch bank, from the beginning down to this day. On
the contrary, the life of the institution lies in a quick circulation
and frequent turning over of a moderate capital
amongst a <i>multitude of traders of good credit</i>. The capital of
an English joint-stock bank too often is an African river losing
itself in sands: that of a Scotch bank is a river dispersed
in a thousand channels of irrigation, to reappear in
its entire form, and with increased volume, after it has done
its work. We do not believe, after all, that there is any
great witchcraft about banking in Scotland. The prudence
shown there is no more than what might be expected of
rational men. The failures in England are to be accounted
for not by their want of some extraordinary gift which
chances to have been vouchsafed to their northern neighbours,
but by the fact, that England is full of people hastening
over-much to be rich, and in whose circumstances there
are of course great vicissitudes. If ever England shall cool
a little in Mammon-worship, and pursue business objects
with the moderation of the Scottish mind, it may succeed
in joint-stock banking to as great an extent as Scotland has
done.]</p></div>

<h2><a name="PROFESSIONAL_LIFE" id="PROFESSIONAL_LIFE">PROFESSIONAL LIFE.</a></h2>


<p>I cannot give you, my young friends, a better description
of a successful professional struggle, and the wear and tear
of life, than that which the commentary of Dr Johnson
upon the life of Cheyne affords. It is drawn by the graphic
pen of the late editor of the 'Medico-Chirurgical Review,'
an eloquent Irishman, himself a successful struggler. He
adds&mdash;'We have followed Cheyne in his march up-hill&mdash;we
see him at its summit&mdash;we are to see him going down.
Such are the objects of human desires&mdash;sought with avidity&mdash;obtained
with difficulty&mdash;enjoyed with disappointment&mdash;and
often, in themselves, the source of irreparable
evils. <i>Success</i> in a profession now-a-days has entailed, and
entails, such labour on its possessor, that few who know its
real nature can envy it. Success means wealth and eminence
bought with the sacrifice of all healthy recreation
both of body and mind. The daily toil is relieved only by
the nightly anxiety; and, worn by almost uninterrupted
exertion, the <i>fortunate</i> man is deprived of most of the social
pleasures of life, and debarred from indulgence in its most
cherished affections. He acquires property, loses his
health, and often leaves the wealth of his industry to be
squandered by children whom it demoralises.' Besides
all this, remember that it has been truly said, in the most
elevated position there is the least liberty, because that
very elevation invites observation, and excites <i>envy</i>. That
merit and that ability which would have carried a man
successfully through the crowd, will be found insufficient
for him who is the object of general scrutiny. You should
recollect, gentlemen, that even the position won by merit
and ability may be lost by a want of that continued energy
and persevering struggle which overcame all the obstacles
opposed to your pioneering ascent. The champion in our
profession, like in that of Christianity, must be ever progressing.
A fall from an eminence is always perilous&mdash;in
the medical sphere, <i>fatal</i> to <i>fame</i>. The world, in respect to
our calling, may be esteemed as a school; the boy who has
obtained head place must labour assiduously to <i>retain</i> that
position against his less fortunate competitors. Remember
that sympathy is enlisted for the swimmer to the shore,
against the buffeting billows, rather than for the individual
who had encountered the same obstacles, the same dangers,
and the same difficulties, but who has now apparently
surmounted and escaped all.&mdash;<i>Lecture by Dr Hayden.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ROUGET_DE_LISLE_AND_THE_MARSEILLAISE" id="ROUGET_DE_LISLE_AND_THE_MARSEILLAISE">ROUGET DE L'ISLE AND THE 'MARSEILLAISE.'</a></h2>


<p>There appeared recently in this Journal the <i>fabulous</i>
account of the origin of the 'Marseillaise:' the following
is said to be the <i>fact</i>:&mdash;In April 1792, at the opening of the
campaign against Austria and Prussia, Rouget de l'Isle
was a captain of engineers stationed at Strasburg. The
day before the volunteers from that city were about to
join the main army of the Rhine, M. Dietrich, mayor of
the city, gave an entertainment, at which Rouget de l'Isle
and several other officers were present. A question arose
as to what air should be played on the departure of the
new levies; and it was thought desirable that some appropriate
and spirited national song should be chosen. Various
pieces having been tried and rejected as unsuitable to the
occasion, Rouget de l'Isle left the company, retired to his
own rooms, and in the course of the evening wrote the
words and music of 'Le Chant de l'Armée du Rhin.' Before
the party at the <i>mairie</i> broke up, he returned with his
composition. Mademoiselle Dietrich accompanied him on
the piano, and he sang the inspiriting song to the delight
of all present. It was immediately put in rehearsal, played
at parade the next day, and its popularity at once established.
Gradually it spread through France, the Marseillais
sang it on entering Paris, and the name it now bears
was irrevocably substituted for the original title. It was
produced on the stage of the Opera at Paris in October
1792, much in the style in which Rachel gave it in 1848,
and was received by the audience as enthusiastically as it
had been by the populace.</p></div>

<p>Boys, you have heard of blacksmiths who became mayors
and magistrates of towns and cities, and men of great
wealth and influence. What was the secret of their success?
Why, they picked up nails and pins in the street,
and carried them home in the pockets of their waistcoats.
Now, you must pick up thoughts in the same way, and fill
your mind with them; and they will grow into other
thoughts almost while you are asleep. The world is full
of thoughts, and you will find them strewed everywhere
